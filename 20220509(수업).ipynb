He\\'s just some guy I work with\\nC\\'mon, you\\'re going out with the guy! There\\'s gotta be something wrong with him\\nAll right Joey, be nice.Ê So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece\\nWait, does he eat chalk\\nJust, \\'cause, I don\\'t want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh\\nOkay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It\\'s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex\\nSounds like a date to me\\nAlright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked\\nOh, yeah. Had that dream\\nThen I look down, and I realize there\\'s a phone... there\\nInstead of...\\nThat\\'s right\\nNever had that dream\\nNo\\nAll of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me\\nAnd they weren\\'t looking at you before?\\nFinally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me\\n(mortified) Hi\\nThis guy says hello, I wanna kill myself\\nAre you okay, sweetie\\nI just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..\\nCookie\\n(explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today\\nOhh\\n(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee\\nThanks\\nOoh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross\\nNo, no don\\'t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay\\nFine!Ê Be murky\\nI\\'ll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she\\'ll be very happy\\nNo you don\\'t\\nNo I don\\'t, to hell with her, she left me\\nAnd you never knew she was a lesbian..\\nNo!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn\\'t know, how should I know\\nSometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud\\nI told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well\\nOh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have grandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what?Ê A wrong number\\nSorry\\nAlright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of pain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is\\nStrip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some hormones\\nI don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again\\nAnd I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully\\nRachel?\\nOh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are\\nCan I get you some coffee\\n(pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross\\nHi, sure\\nHi\\nSo you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids\\nOh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city\\nWho wasn\\'t invited to the wedding\\nOoh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on\\nNow I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it\\n(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?Ê Decide\\n(in a deep voice) I\\'ll have whatever Christine is having\\n(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can\\'t marry him! I\\'m sorry. I just don\\'t love him. Well, it matters to me\\n(re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants\\nI say push her down the stairs\\nC\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy\\nYou can see where he\\'d have trouble\\nLook Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica\\nWell, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica..\\nWell, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!\\nJust breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things..\\n(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.Ê These are a few..\\nI\\'m all better now\\n(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped\\nOkay, look, this is probably for the best, y\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.Ê The whole, \\'hat\\' thing\\n(comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot\\nJoey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding day\\nWhat, like there\\'s a rule or something\\nPlease don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound\\n(over the intercom) It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Paul\\nOh God, is it 6:30?Ê Buzz him in\\nWho\\'s Paul\\nPaul the Wine Guy, Paul\\nMaybe. Joey: Wait. Your \\'not a real date\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy\\nHe finally asked you out\\nYes\\nOoh, this is a Dear Diary moment\\nRach, wait, I can cancel..\\nPlease, no, go, that\\'d be fine\\n(to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay\\n(choked voice) That\\'d be good..\\n(horrified) Really\\n(normal voice) No, go on! It\\'s Paul the Wine Guy\\nWhat does that mean? Ê Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn\\'t know\\nHi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul\\nHey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey\\nI\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name. Paul, was it\\nOkay, umm-umm, I\\'ll just--I\\'ll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..\\nA wandering\\nChange!Ê Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds\\nOoh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can\\'t be good\\nYeah\\nHere\\'s a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red\\n(yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey\\nSo Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up to tonight\\nWell, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing\\nRight, you\\'re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don\\'t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture\\n(deadpan) Yes, and we\\'re very excited about it\\nWell actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just gonna hang out here tonight.Ê It\\'s been kinda a long day\\nOkay, sure\\nHey Pheebs, you wanna help\\nOh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to\\nThe Subway, Phoebe is singing for change\\n(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.Ê La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh\\nRoss\\'s Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture\\n(squatting and reading the instructions) I\\'m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs\\nI\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a bookcase here\\nIt\\'s a beautiful thing\\n(picking up a leftover part) What\\'s this\\nI would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket\\nWhich goes where\\nI have no idea\\nDone with the bookcase\\nAll finished\\n(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol\\'s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known\\nHey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re gonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here\\nYes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun\\nRoss, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get\\nYou guys\\nOh, God\\nYou got screwed\\nOh my God\\nA Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating\\nOh my God\\nI know, I know, I\\'m such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get\\nMy brother\\'s going through that right now, he\\'s such a mess. How did you get through it\\n-leg\\n(laughing) That\\'s one way! Me, I- I went for the watch\\nYou actually broke her watch?Ê Wow!Ê The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel\\nOoh, steer clear of you\\nThat\\'s right. [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing\\nBarry, I\\'m sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn\\'t... it isn\\'t, it\\'s about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn\\'t me, it\\'s not me.Ê And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials\\nRoss\\'s Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture\\nI\\'m divorced!Ê I\\'m only 26 and I\\'m divorced\\nShut up\\nYou must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses\\nThat only took me an hour\\nLook, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. Ê You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Ê Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!Ê I don\\'t think that was my point\\nYou know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..\\nWhat are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon\\nI honestly don\\'t know if I\\'m hungry or horny\\nStay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating\\nEver since she walked out on me, I, uh..\\nWhat?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles\\nNo, it\\'s, it\\'s more of a fifth date kinda revelation\\nOh, so there is gonna be a fifth date\\nIsn\\'t there\\nYeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say\\nWell, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven\\'t been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually\\n(spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..\\nIt\\'s okay..\\nI know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long\\nTwo years\\nWow! I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m glad you smashed her watch\\nSo you still think you, um... might want that fifth date\\n(pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do\\nMonica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne Loves Chaci\\nWe are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony\\nOh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That\\'s the difference\\nRoss\\'s Apartment, they\\'re all sitting around and talking\\n(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it\\'s been since I\\'ve grabbed a spoon? Do the words \\'Billy, don\\'t be a hero\\' mean anything to you\\nGreat story!Ê But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea..\\nAngela\\'s the screamer, Andrea has cats\\nRight.Ê Thanks.Ê It\\'s June.Ê I\\'m outta here. (Exits\\nY\\'know, here\\'s the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window\\nMonica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler\\nIsn\\'t this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life\\nThat is amazing\\nCongratulations\\nY\\'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do\\nIf can invade Poland, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do\\nListen, while you\\'re on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I\\'m really not that hungry..\\n(entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here\\nMorning. Good morning\\n(entering from Monica\\'s room) Morning\\nMorning, Paul\\nHello, Paul\\nHi, Paul, is it\\nThank you!Ê Thank you so much\\nStop\\nNo, I\\'m telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness\\nWe\\'ll talk later\\nYeah. (They kiss) Thank you\\nThat wasn\\'t a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date\\nShut up, and put my table back\\nOkayyy! (They do so\\nAll right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don\\'t input those numbers,... it doesn\\'t make much of a difference..\\nSo, like, you guys all have jobs\\nYeah, we all have jobs. See, that\\'s how we buy stuff\\nYeah, I\\'m an actor\\nWow! Would I have seen you in anything\\nI doubt it. Mostly regional work\\nOh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns\\' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park\\nLook, it was a job all right\\n\\'Look, Gippetto, I\\'m a real live boy\\nI will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave\\nYou\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) \"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..\\nYou should both know, that he\\'s a dead man.Ê Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler\\nSo how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can\\'t stop smiling\\nI can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth\\nI know, he\\'s just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco\\nOh, yeah\\nWell, it\\'s like that. With feelings\\nOh wow. Are you in trouble\\nBig time\\nWant a wedding dress? Ê Hardly used\\nI think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I\\'m just gonna get up and go to work\\nOh, look, wish me luck\\nWhat for\\nI\\'m gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things\\nIridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters\\nHey, Monica\\nHey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida\\nYou had sex, didn\\'t you\\nHow do you do that\\nOh, I hate you, I\\'m pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you\\'re having sex!Ê So? Who\\nYou know Paul\\nPaul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul\\nYou mean you know Paul like I know Paul\\nAre you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y\\'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years\\nCentral Perk, everyone but Rachel is there\\n(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line\\nWhy?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that\\nI assume we\\'re looking for an answer more sophisticated than \\'to get you into bed\\'\\nI hate men!Ê I hate men\\nOh no, don\\'t hate, you don\\'t want to put that out into the universe\\nIs it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear\\nAll right, c\\'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them\\nI just thought he was nice, y\\'know\\n(bursts out laughing again) I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t know it was a line\\nGuess what\\nYou got a job\\nAre you kidding? I\\'m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today\\nAnd yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat\\nYou would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off\\nOh, how well you know me..\\nThey\\'re my new \\'I don\\'t need a job, I don\\'t need my parents, I\\'ve got great boots\\' boots\\nHow\\'d you pay for them\\nUh, credit card\\nAnd who pays for that\\nUm... my... father\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table. Ê Rachel\\'s credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors\\nOh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?Ê I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want\\nC\\'mon, you can\\'t live off your parents your whole life\\nI know that. That\\'s why I was getting married\\nGive her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time\\nThank you\\nYou\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel\\nThe word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'..\\nAll right, you ready\\nNo.Ê No, no, I\\'m not ready!Ê How can I be ready?Ê \"Hey, Rach!Ê You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"Ê Come on, I can\\'t do this\\nYou can, I know you can\\nI don\\'t think so\\nCome on, you made coffee! Ê You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it\\nC\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..\\nCut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer\\nY\\'know what?Ê I think we can just leave it at that.Ê It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture..\\nCut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.\\n(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y\\'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream\\nWelcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re gonna love it\\nWell, that\\'s it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch\\nNo. No, I gotta go home sometime\\nYou be okay\\nYeah\\nHey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What\\nThat\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody\\nGoodnight\\nMmm\\nSplit it\\nOkay\\nOkay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you\\nI knew\\nYou did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky older brother\\nI did\\nOh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe\\nYeah, maybe..\\nOkay... okay, maybe I will..\\nGoodnight\\nGoodnight\\nSee ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you\\nI just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there\\nI can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here\\n(sings) I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here..\\nWhat\\n(sings) What I said you had..\\n(to Phoebe) Would you stop\\nOh, was I doing it again\\nYes\\nI said that you had a nice butt, it\\'s just not a great butt\\nOh, you wouldn\\'t know a great butt if it came up and bit ya\\nThere\\'s an image\\n(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee\\nDid you make it, or are you just serving it\\nI\\'m just serving it\\nYeah. Yeah, I\\'ll have a cup of coffee\\nKids, new dream... I\\'m in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler\\'s dream\\n(To Rachel) Ahh, miss? Ê More coffee\\nUgh. (To another customer that\\'s leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.Ê Okay, Las Vegas\\nOkay, so, I\\'m in Las Vegas..\\nWhat you guys don\\'t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it\\nYeah, right!.......Y\\'serious\\nOh, yeah\\nEverything you need to know is in that first kiss\\nAbsolutely\\nYeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out\\nYeah, and-and it\\'s not that we don\\'t like the comedian, it\\'s that-that... that\\'s not why we bought the ticket\\nThe problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake\\nYeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you\\'re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone\\n(pause)....Are we still talking about sex\\nMuseum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people\\nNo, it\\'s good, it is good, it\\'s just that- mm- doesn\\'t she seem a little angry\\nWell, she has issues\\nDoes she\\nHe\\'s out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet\\nMarsha, these are cave people.

Hi\\nOkay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I\\'ll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age\\nSo\\nYou look great. I, uh... I hate that\\nSorry. You look good too\\nAh, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what\\'s new? Still, uh..\\nA lesbian\\nWell... you never know. How\\'s, um.. how\\'s the family\\nMarty\\'s still totally paranoid\\nWhy- why are you here, Carol\\nI\\'m pregnant\\nPregnant?\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three\\'s Company\\nOh, I think this is the episode of Three\\'s Company where there\\'s some kind of misunderstanding\\n(taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that\\nYeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down\\nWhose little ball of paper is this?\\nOh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn\\'t need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead\\nShe\\'s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you\\'ve already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it\\'s fine\\nLook , I\\'m sorry, guys, I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have\\nYes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow\\nMonica- Hi! Um, Monica, you\\'re scaring me. I mean, you\\'re like, you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way\\nYeah, calm down. You don\\'t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come\\nThat\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y\\'see, he\\'s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born\\n(looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew\\nWhat\\nUgly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster\\nEeaagh\\nHas anybody seen my engagement ring\\nYeah, it\\'s beautiful\\nOh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions\\nNo, look, don\\'t touch that\\nOh, like I wasn\\'t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... \\'Hi Barry! Remember me? I\\'m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!\\' Oh God and now I\\'m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..\\nEasy Rach, we\\'ll find it. (To all) Won\\'t we\\nOh! Yeah\\nAlright, when\\'d\\'ya have it on last\\nDoy! Probably right before she lost it\\nYou don\\'t get a lot of \\'doy\\' these days..\\nI know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..\\n...Dinah\\n(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don\\'t be mad..\\nYou didn\\'t\\nOh, I am sorry..\\nI gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan\\nOh, but look how straight those noodles are\\nNow, Monica, you know that\\'s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..\\n(puts down the lasagne) I just... can\\'t do it\\nBoys? We\\'re going in\\n(standing outside the door).....Hi\\nWow. That is not a happy hi\\nCarol\\'s pregnant\\n(while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it\\nW-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-..\\nYeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters\\nKinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon\\nWell now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing\\nWell, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I\\'m not comfortable with it, I don\\'t have to be involved.. basically it\\'s entirely up to me\\nShe is so great! I miss her\\nWhat does she mean by \\'involved\\'\\nI mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done\\nAnyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow\\nSo what are you gonna do\\nI have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I\\'m still gonna be a father\\n.....Well, this is still ruined, right\\nOh, Martha Ludwin\\'s daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What\\'s that curry taste\\nCurry\\nMmmm\\nI- I think they\\'re great! I, I really do\\n(To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn\\'t she\\nThey all had a thing for him\\nAw, Mom..\\nI\\'m sorry, why is this girl going to call me\\nOh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don\\'t know\\nNo Mom, I don\\'t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant\\nWell, they don\\'t have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier\\nRoss, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please\\nYeah. (They go to the kitchen\\nOh, we\\'re having spaghetti! That\\'s.... easy\\nI know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me\\nWhat that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well\\nI\\'m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money\\nWell, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..\\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean\\nNothing! It\\'s an expression\\nNo it\\'s not\\nDon\\'t listen to your mother. You\\'re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..\\nLook, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I\\'m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer\\n...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God \\'Our Little Harmonica\\' doesn\\'t seem to have that problem\\n(trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what\\'s going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks\\n(pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here\\'s the deal. Carol\\'s a lesbian. She\\'s living with a woman named Susan. She\\'s pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby\\n(To Monica) And you knew about this?\\nCentral Park, everyone\\'s there\\nYour folks are really that bad, huh\\nWell, y\\'know, these people are pros. They know what they\\'re doing, they take their time, they get the job done\\nBoy, I know they say you can\\'t change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I\\'d want yours\\nMust pee. (Goes to pee\\nY\\'know, it\\'s even worse when you\\'re twins\\nYou\\'re twins\\nYeah. We don\\'t speak. She\\'s like this high-powered, driven career type\\nWhat does she do\\nShe\\'s a waitress\\nAll right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave\\nChandler, you\\'re an only child, right? You don\\'t have any of this\\nWell, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred\\nThe lights, please.\\n...How long was I in there\\nI\\'m just cleaning up\\nD\\'ya.. uh.. d\\'ya need any help\\nUh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down\\nAnyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow\\nOh.. a little.\\nMm-hmm.\\nA lot\\nMm\\nSo, got any advice? Y\\'know, as someone who\\'s recently been- dumped\\nWell, you may wanna steer clear of the word \\'dumped\\'. Chances are he\\'s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y\\'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it\\'ll be hard. Or, y\\'know, uh, hey!, I\\'ll go down there, and I\\'ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..\\nOh, you\\'ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated\\nGot me\\nRemember when we were in high school together\\nYeah\\nI mean, didn\\'t you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that\\'d be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross\\nYes, yes\\nOh! Man, I never thought I\\'d be here.. (She leans back onto his hand\\nMe either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn\\'t have to move his hand\\nCarol\\'s OB/GYN, Carol is waiting\\n(entering) Sorry I\\'m late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway\\nHi\\nRoss, you remember Susan\\nHow could I forget\\nRoss\\n(they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we\\'re just waiting for...\\nDr. Oberman\\n..Dr. Oberman. Okay\\nShe\\n-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation\\nYes, and she\\'s very supportive\\nOkay, that\\'s great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I\\'m- Oh\\nThanks\\n(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.\\nRoss? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror\\nBarry\\nC\\'mon in\\n(hesitates) Are you sure\\nYeah! It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Robbie\\'s gonna be here for hours\\nHuh?\\nSo, how ya doin\\nI\\'m- uh- I\\'m okay... You look great\\nYeah, well.\\n(over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein\\'s gagging\\n(answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec\\nI dumped him\\nOkay\\nCarol\\'s OB/GYN, they\\'re talking about how this is going to work\\nSo, um- so how\\'s this, uh, how\\'s this gonna work? Y\\'know, with us? Y\\'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made\\nGive me a \\'for instance\\'\\nWell, uh, uh, I don\\'t know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby\\'s name\\nMarlon?\\n-if it\\'s a boy, Minnie if it\\'s a girl\\n...As in Mouse\\nAs in my grandmother\\nStill, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia\\nJulia.\\nWe agreed on Minnie\\n\\'S\\'funny, um, uh, we agreed we\\'d spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia\\'s on the table..\\nBarry\\'s office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry\\'s lamp as Barry enters\\nSorry about that. So. What have you been up to\\nOh, not much.

They haven\\'t quite taken yet\\nAnd you\\'ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye\\nNot for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you\\nOkay.\\nSee, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I\\'ve ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I\\'m an orthodontist\\nWow\\nYou know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren\\'t happy. But with Mindy, now I\\'m happy. Spit\\nWhat\\nMe. (Spits\\nAnyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me\\nWell, thank you for giving it back\\nHello?\\nCarol\\'s OB/GYN, they\\'re still arguing about what to name the baby\\nOh, please!

It\\'s not gonna be Helen Geller\\nThank you\\nNo, I mean it\\'s not Geller\\nWhat, it\\'s gonna be Helen Willick\\nNo, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch\\nWell, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title\\nIt\\'s my baby too\\nOh, \\'s\\'funny, really? Um, I don\\'t remember you making any sperm\\nYeah, and we all know what a challenge that is\\nAll right, you two, stop it\\nNo no no, she gets a credit, hey, I\\'m in there too\\nRoss. You\\'re not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? \\'Cause I think that borders on child abuse\\nOf course not, I\\'m... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch\\nOh, no, nonononono, you see what he\\'s doing? He knows no-one\\'s gonna say all those names, so they\\'ll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way\\nMy way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y\\'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard\\n(entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea\\nYeah. Yeah. A little\\nWell, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.\\nYou- uh- y\\'know what, I\\'m gonna go.

He said \\'we should do it again\\', that\\'s good, right\\nUh, no. Loosely translated \\'We should do this again\\' means \\'You will never see me naked\\'\\nSince when\\nSince always. It\\'s like dating language. Y\\'know, like \\'It\\'s not you\\' means \\'It is you\\'\\nOr \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'\\nOr, or, y\\'know, um, \\'I think we should see other people\\' means \\'Ha, ha, I already am\\'\\nAnd everybody knows this\\nYeah. Cushions the blow\\nYeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm\\nThat\\'s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm\\nUh, Ross\\nWhat?

No. Give it to me\\nNo no no, I am not giving you a cigarette\\nIt\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here\\nDon\\'t think of it as a cigarette.

Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke\\nNo, no, no.

I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they\\'re all over him. I mean, they\\'re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd\\nListen. As someone who\\'s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I\\'ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they\\'re your friends, they\\'re just looking out after you\\nI know. I just wish that once, I\\'d bring a guy home that they actually liked\\nWell, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent\\nLet it go, Ross\\nYeah, well, you didn\\'t know Chi Chi\\nDo you all promise\\nYeah!

We\\'re talking about someone that I\\'m going out with\\nYeah\\nAnd did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger\\n(reluctantly) Yeah\\nKnow what was great?

D\\'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.\\nWhat\\n..I dunno, a little too Alan\\nWell, no. That\\'s impossible.

So if that sounds like I\\'m okay, okay, then you can tell them I\\'m okay, okay\\n(pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back\\nAlright, c\\'mon! (Miserably) Let\\'s play Twister\\nMadison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats\\n(squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh\\nWhat? There was ice there that night with Carol?

I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who\\'s he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c\\'mon Dora, don\\'t be mad... I know we both said some things we didn\\'t mean, but that doesn\\'t mean we still don\\'t love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y\\'know, I feel like I\\'ve lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are all out on the balcony\\nLight still out\\nYeah\\nOh. Maybe they\\'re- napping\\nOh please, they\\'re having sex\\nShut up\\nSo, whaddya think George is like\\nI think he\\'s shy\\nYeah\\nYeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he\\'s a preppy animal\\nThe Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol\\nI remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow\\nYes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please\\nHe\\'s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that\\nLook, it\\'s just a little more complicated..\\nWell, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women\\nLittle louder, okay, I think there\\'s a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn\\'t quite hear you..\\nThen what\\nMy first time with Carol was..\\nWhat\\nIt was my first time\\nWith Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh\\nSo in your whole life, you\\'ve only been with oneÑ(He gets a look too)Ñoh\\nWhoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!

I\\'m fine\\nCentral Perk, all six are there\\nWould you let it go? It\\'s not that big a deal\\nNot that big a deal? It\\'s amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there\\'s one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I\\'m concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right\\nCome on! You guys can pee standing up\\nWe can? All right, I\\'m tryin\\' that\\nOk, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me\\nOh, ok, you know what I don\\'t get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care\\nMultiple orgasms\\nCentral Perk, all are there\\nSo, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night\\nNo plans, huh\\nNot a one\\nNot even, say, breaking up with Janice\\nOh, right, right, shut up\\nChandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it\\nNo, I know, but it\\'s just so hard, you know? I mean, you\\'re sitting there with her, she has no idea what\\'s happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there\\'s the horrible awkward moment when you\\'ve handed her the note\\nWhy do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling\\nYou know, if you want, I\\'ll do it with you\\nOh, thanks, but I think she\\'d feel like we\\'re gangin\\' up on her\\nNo, I mean you break up with Janice and I\\'ll break up with Tony\\nTony\\nOh, you\\'re breaking up with Tony\\nYeah, I know, he\\'s sweet, but it\\'s just not fun anymore, you know? I don\\'t know if it\\'s me, or his hunger strike, or, I don\\'t know\\n(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else\\nOh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I\\'m fine\\n(to Rachel) What\\'s the matter? Why so scrunchy\\nIt\\'s my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible\\nThat guy, he burns me up\\nYeah, well, it\\'s a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady\\nOoh, I hate when my father calls me that\\nDid he give you that whole \"You\\'re-not-up-to-this\" thing again\\nOh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You\\'ll never make it on your own\"\\n(rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh\\nHi, Joey\\nMy god, Angela\\nWow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her\\nAre you gonna go over there\\nNo, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don\\'t wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela\\n(casually) Joey\\nYou look good\\nThat\\'s because I\\'m wearing a dress that accents my boobs\\nYou don\\'t say\\nSo, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what\\'re you doing tonight\\nOh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama\\nOh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who\\'s doing laundry there too\\nWho\\nMe. Was that not clear? Hey, why don\\'t, um, why don\\'t I just join you both, here\\nDon\\'t you have a laundry room in your building\\nYes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there\\'s a.... rat problem. Apparently they\\'re attracted to the dryer sheets, and they\\'re goin\\' in fine, but they\\'re comin\\' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish\\nSure\\nForget it Joey. I\\'m with Bob now\\nBob? Who the hell\\'s Bob\\nBob is great. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob..\\nCome on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too\\nYeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let\\'s just be friends, so guess what\\nWhat\\nWe\\'re just friends\\nFine, fine, so, why don\\'t the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends\\nWhat four of us\\nYou know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela\\'s boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself\\nMonica, I\\'m tellin\\' you, this guy is perfect for you\\nForget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet\\nCome on. This guy\\'s great. His name\\'s Bob. He\\'s Angela\\'s... brother. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..\\n(looking out window) Oh, god help us\\nWhat\\nUgly Naked Guy\\'s laying kitchen tile. Eww\\nEww! Look, I\\'m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me\\nWhat\\'s going on here? You go out with tons of girls\\n(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please\\nRoss\\' apartment, Chandler is over\\n(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica\\'s not coming, it\\'s just gonna be me and Rachel\\nOh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you\\'ve thought this thing through\\nIt\\'s laundry. The thinking through is minimal\\nIt\\'s just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You\\'re going on a date\\nNuh-uh\\nYuh-huh\\nSo what\\'re you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what\\nWell, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

Ok, you caught me. I\\'m a laundry virgin\\nUh, well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll use the gentle cycle.

(she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it\\nThe laundromat\\nOk, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do\\nThat does not sound stupid to me. You know, it\\'s like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I\\'m sorry, that\\'s all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh\\nWhat uh-oh\\n(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry\\'s done. It\\'s, uh, it\\'s a song. The laundry song that we sing.

How could you get involved with a woman like this\\nWell, y\\'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy\\'s fantasy\\nOh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy\\nNo, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is\\nWhat? So you guys don\\'t mind going out with someone else who\\'s going out with someone else\\nI couldn\\'t do it\\nGood for you, Joey\\nWhen I\\'m with a woman, I need to know that I\\'m going out with more people than she is\\nWell, y\\'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept\\nFine.

Just for fun, let\\'s see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let\\'s see. Well, it looks good there too. Let\\'s just leave it there for a while\\n(to Rachel) I can\\'t believe you tried to move the green ottoman\\nThank God you didn\\'t try to fan out the magazines.

(to Monica) What\\'s my number\\nWell, I never call me\\nATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler\\'s thoughts are in italics\\nOh my God, it\\'s that Victoria\\'s Secret model. Something... something Goodacre\\n(on phone) Hi Mom, it\\'s Jill\\nShe\\'s right, it\\'s Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it\\'s an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot\\n(on phone) Yeah, I\\'m fine. I\\'m just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule\\nJill says vestibule... I\\'m going with vestibule\\n(on phone) I\\'m fine. No, I\\'m not alone... I don\\'t know, some guy\\nOh! Some guy. Some guy. \\'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy\\nMonica\\'s apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit\\nHi everyone\\nAnd officiating at tonight\\'s blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani\\nWell, Chandler\\'s old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so...

Yeah, thanks\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, The phone rings; it\\'s Chandler\\nHello\\nHey, it\\'s me\\n(to everyone) It\\'s Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK\\nYeah, I\\'m fine.

The five are sitting around the coffee table talking\\nAlright, somebody\\nOK, I\\'ll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table\\nWhoooaa\\nThat\\'s my sister\\nOK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women\\'s room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library\\nOh my God! What were you doing in a library\\nPheebs, what about you\\nOh... Milwaukee\\nUm... Ross\\nDisneyland, 1989, \\'It\\'s a Small World After All\\nNo way\\nThe ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom\\nOh, Rachel\\nOh come on, I already went\\nYou did not go\\nCome on\\nOh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed\\nStep back\\nWe have a winner\\nI just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park\\nWell, it was the only thing to do there that didn\\'t have a line\\nThere, well, see? Barry wouldn\\'t even kiss me on a miniature golf course\\nCome on\\nNo, he said we were holding up the people behind us\\n(sarcastically) And you didn\\'t marry him because...\\nI mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..\\nProbably. But you know, I\\'ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated\\nYeah right\\nIt is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you\\'re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there\\'s all that other good stuff\\n(sigh) OK\\nBut, um... I don\\'t think that\\'s going to be you\\nYou don\\'t\\nUh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future\\nReally\\nMmmm\\nYou do\\nI do\\nOh Ross, you\\'re so great\\nIt\\'s never gonna happen\\n(innocently) What\\nYou and Rachel\\n(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not\\nBecause you waited too long to make your move, and now you\\'re in the friend zone\\nNo, no, no. I\\'m not in the zone\\nRoss, you\\'re mayor of the zone\\nI\\'m taking my time, alright? I\\'m laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to..\\nPriesthood! Look Ross, I\\'m telling you, she has no idea what you\\'re thinking. If you don\\'t ask her out soon you\\'re going to end up stuck in the zone forever\\nI will, I will. See, I\\'m waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now\\nYeeeeaaaahhh! What\\'s messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You\\'ve just got to go up to her and say, \\'Rachel, I think that..\\nShhhh\\nWhat are you shushing\\nWe\\'re shushing... because... we\\'re trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don\\'t you hear that\\nAhhhh\\nSee\\nHuh\\nATM vestibule\\nWould you like some gum\\nUm, is it sugarless\\n(checks) Sorry, it\\'s not\\nOh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it\\nMonica\\'s apartment, Phoebe is singing\\n(singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, \\'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la..\\n(to Joey) OK, here goes\\nAre you going to do it\\nI\\'m going to do it\\nDo you want any help\\nYou come out there, you\\'re a dead man\\nGood luck, man\\nThanks. (Joey hugs him) OK\\nOK\\nHey, where are you going\\nOutside\\nYou can\\'t go out there\\nWhy not\\nBecause of... the reason\\nAnd that would be\\nI, um, can\\'t tell you\\nJoey, what\\'s going on\\nOK, you\\'ve got to promise that you\\'ll never, ever tell Ross that I told you\\nAbout what\\nHe\\'s planning your birthday party\\nOh my God! I love him\\n(as Phoebe enters) You\\'d better act surprised\\nAbout what\\nMy surprise party\\nWhat surprise party\\nOh stop it. Joey already told me\\nWell, he didn\\'t tell me\\nHey, don\\'t look at me. This is Ross\\'s thing\\nThis is so typical. I\\'m always the last one to know everything\\nNo, you are not. We tell you stuff\\nYuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking\\nHmmm... this is so nice\\nOK, I have a question. Well, actually, it\\'s not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment\\nOK\\nOK. Here goes. For a while now, I\\'ve been wanting to, um...\\nOhhh!!!\\nYes, yes, that\\'s right..\\nOh, look at the little cat\\nWhat? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow\\n(singing) I\\'m on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I\\'ve found ever since..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the scratches on Ross\\' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound\\n(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won\\'t hurt\\nSorry, that was wax\\nOh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner\\nWhy don\\'t we just put \\'poor little Tooty\\' out in the hall\\nDuring a blackout? He\\'d get trampled\\n(nonchalantly) Yeah\\nATM vestibule\\nYou know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) \\'Gum would be perfection\\'? \\'Gum would be perfection.\\' Could have said \\'gum would be nice,\\' or \\'I\\'ll have a stick,\\' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself\\nThe hallway of Monica\\'s building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the cat\\'s owner\\n(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right\\nOh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we\\'re looking for the owner\\nEr, yeah, it\\'s mine\\n(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure\\nYeah, it\\'s my cat. Give me my cat\\nWait a minute. What\\'s his name\\nEhhhh... B-Buttons\\nBob Buttons\\nMmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons\\n(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man\\n(as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat\\nRachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat\\'s owner\\nHere, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..\\nWow\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly\\n(rolling) Lucky sixes...\\n(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica\\n(smitten) Hi\\nAnd Joey...\\nHi\\nAnd Ross\\nHi\\n(proudly) He doesn\\'t speak much English\\n(pointing at game) Monopoly\\nLook at that\\n(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from\\nOh... Italy, I think\\nNo, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives\\nWell, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo\\'s cat\\nThat, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him\\nAlright. I looked all over the building and I couldn\\'t find the kitty anywhere\\nOh, I found him. He was Paolo\\'s cat\\nAh! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I\\'m guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo\\nAh, Paolo, this is Phoebe\\n(smiling) You betcha\\nATM vestibule\\n(chewing gum) Ah, let\\'s see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble\\'s good. It\\'s got a... boyish charm, it\\'s impish. Here we go\\nNice going, imp. OK, it\\'s OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth\\nGood save! We\\'re back on track, and I\\'m... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else\\'s gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you\\'re choking\\nAre you alright\\nMy God, you\\'re choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better\\n(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was...\\nPerfection\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are watching disgustedly\\n(mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...\\nWha-What did he say that was so funny\\nI have absolutely no idea\\nThat\\'s... that\\'s classic\\n(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me\\nIf you want, I\\'ll do it\\nI know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won\\'t\\nGod, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry\\nYou know, did you ride mopeds? \\'Cause I\\'ve heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it\\'s not about that right now. OK\\nY\\'know, I know it\\'s totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don\\'t even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...\\nPaolo. Hi\\nRoss\\nListen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we\\'re kind of a thing\\nThing\\nThing, yes. Thing\\nAh, you... have the sex\\nNo, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that\\'s... see, that\\'s not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..\\nBed\\nNo, no, that\\'s not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad\\nOh\\nYeah! Se vice\\nSi\\nSo you do know a little English\\nPoco... a leetle\\nDo you know the word crapweasel\\nNo\\nThat\\'s funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel\\nATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen around his head\\nChandler, we\\'ve been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it\\'s easy\\nOK\\nReady\\nNo, you\\'ve got to whip it\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the gang is all sitting around the table\\nOh, look look look. The last candle\\'s about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...

Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..\\nOh.. oh... oh\\nHey Ross. This probably isn\\'t the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica\\nATM vestibule, the power has come back on\\nWell, this has been fun\\nYes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life\\nWell, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya\\nHi, um, I\\'m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don\\'t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape\\nChandler\\'s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break. Ê Shelley enters\\nHey gorgeous, how\\'s it going\\nDehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this\\nQuestion. You\\'re not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you\\nAh, y\\'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said \\'co-dependent\\', or \\'self-destructive\\'..\\nDo you want a date Saturday\\nYes please\\nOkay\\nHe\\'s a he\\nWell yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I\\'m just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there\\n...Couldn\\'t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that\\nUm... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y\\'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..\\nYou did\\nYeah, but then you spent Phoebe\\'s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not\\nHuh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me\\nI did\\nYeah, I think so, yeah\\nNot me\\nNono, me neither. Although, uh, y\\'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did\\nYou\\'re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn\\'t\\nNo. No, it\\'s just \\'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..\\nWell, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me\\nI dunno, \\'cause you\\'re smart, you\\'re funny..\\nRoss is smart and funny, d\\'you ever think that about him\\nYeah! Right\\nWHAT IS IT?\\nOkay, I-I d\\'know, you-you just- you have a quality\\nYes. Absolutely. A quality\\nOh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this\\nHello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it\\'s Paolo calling from Rome\\nOh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio\\n(to Joey) So he\\'s calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome\\nMonica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I\\'m talking to Rome\\nHey dad, what\\'s up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it\\'s Nana\\nThe Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses\\nSo, uh, how\\'s she doing\\nThe doctor says it\\'s a matter of hours\\nHow-how are you, Mom\\nMe? I\\'m fine, fine. I\\'m glad you\\'re here. ...What\\'s with your hair\\nWhat\\nWhat\\'s different\\nNothing\\nOh, maybe that\\'s it\\nShe is unbelievable, our mother is..\\nOkay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover\\nOh God\\nThe fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse\\nOh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet \\'n\\' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants\\nNot just restaurants, from our house\\nMrs. Geller\\nShe looks so small\\nI know\\nWell, at least she\\'s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now\\nG\\'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead\\nBye, Nana\\nRoss\\nWhat is going on?\\nY\\'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she\\'s not, quite.\\nWhat\\nShe\\'s not- past, she\\'s present, she\\'s back\\n(reentering) What\\'s going on\\nShe may have died\\nShe may have died\\nWe\\'re looking into it\\nI, uh, I\\'ll go see\\nThis almost never happens\\nNow she\\'s passed\\nCentral Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there\\nI just have to know, okay. Is it my hair\\n(exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that\\'s exactly what it is. It\\'s your hair\\nYeah, you have homosexual hair\\nSo, um, did she..\\nTwice\\nTwice\\nOh, that sucks\\nYou guys okay\\nI dunno, it\\'s weird. I mean, I know she\\'s gone, but I just don\\'t feel, uh..\\nMaybe that\\'s \\'cause she\\'s not really gone\\nNono, she\\'s gone\\nWe checked. A lot\\nHm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she\\'s like right here, y\\'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y\\'know? ...I miss her\\nAw. Hey, Pheebs, want this\\nThanks\\nSure. I just sharpened her this morning\\nNow, see, I don\\'t believe any of that. I think once you\\'re dead, you\\'re dead! You\\'re gone! You\\'re worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh\\nY\\'know, I dunno who this is, but it\\'s not Debbie\\nNana\\'s house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes\\nI thought it was gonna be a closed casket\\nWell, that doesn\\'t mean she can\\'t look nice\\nSweetie, you think you can get in there\\n(sarcastic) I don\\'t see why not\\nHere\\'s my retainer\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is talking to her father\\nI was just thinking\\nDad\\nListen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea\\nYou what\\nI wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun\\nDefine fun\\nC\\'mon, you\\'ll make a day of it! You\\'ll rent a boat, pack a lunch..\\n...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun\\nEveryone thinks they know me. Everyone says \\'Jack Geller, so predictable\\'. Maybe after I\\'m gone, they\\'ll say \\'Buried at sea! Huh!\\'\\nThat\\'s probably what they\\'ll say\\nI\\'d like that\\nChandler\\'s Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters\\nHey, gorgeous\\n(sheepish) Hey\\nNo, nono, don\\'t- don\\'t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake\\nOh! Okay! Phew\\nSo, uh... what do you think it is about me\\nI dunno, uh... you just have a-a..\\n...Quality, right, great\\nY\\'know, it\\'s a shame, because you and Lowell would\\'ve made a great couple\\nLowell? Financial Services\\' Lowell, that\\'s who you saw me with\\nWhat? He\\'s cute\\nWell, yeah... \\'s\\'no Brian in Payroll\\nIs Brian...\\nNo! Uh, I d\\'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I\\'d like to think you\\'d set me up with someone like him\\nWell, I think Brian\\'s a little out of your league\\nExcuse me? You don\\'t think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I\\'m really not\\nNana\\'s Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet\\n(holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one\\nNo\\nI have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy\\nYou know, whatever we pick, she would\\'ve told us it\\'s the wrong one\\nYou\\'re right. We\\'ll go with the burgundy\\nOh! A fine choice. I\\'m coming out\\nWait! We need shoes\\nOkay. Um, how about these\\nThat\\'s really a day shoe\\nAnd where she\\'s going everyone else\\'ll be dressier\\nCould we see something in a slimmer heel\\n(forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work\\nNo, it really should be burgundy\\nMm. Unless we go with a different dress\\nNo! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back\\nOh my God.\\nIs everything all right, dear\\nYeah, just... just Nana stuff\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral\\n(entering) How we doing, you guys ready\\nMom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up.

Paolo sent them from Italy\\nWhat, we-uh- we don\\'t have shoes here, or...\\n(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go\\nWell, don\\'t we look nice all dressed up?...It\\'s stuff like that, isn\\'t it\\nThe cemetary, after the funeral\\nIt was a really beautiful service\\nIt really was.

I\\'m gonna watch it at the reception\\nYou are a frightening, frightening man\\nOh no! My new Paolo shoes\\nOh, I hope they\\'re not ruined\\nGod, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise\\nI know, uh, the air, the-the trees..\\nGod! Ross\\nI\\'m fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..\\nThe Wake, at the Gellers\\' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he\\'s injured\\nOkay, don\\'t worry, I\\'m just checking to see if the muscle\\'s in spasm...huh\\nWhat, what is it\\nYou missed a belt loop\\nOh\\nOkay, it\\'s in spasm\\nHere, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills\\nSorry- Hi, I\\'m Dorothy\\'s daughter\\nHi, I\\'m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is\\nHey, look who\\'s up! How do you feel\\nI feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great\\nWow, those pills really worked, huh\\nNot the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest.

I don\\'t need flowers, I\\'m dead\\'\\nThat sounds like Nana\\nDo you know what it\\'s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say\\n...I can imagine\\nI\\'m telling you, it\\'s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is\\nThat is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her\\nTell her what\\nHow she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example\\nI\\'m not sure I know what you\\'re getting at\\nDo you think things would have been better if you\\'d just told her the truth\\n...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it\\'s nicer when people just get along\\nHuh\\nMore wine, dear\\nOh, I think so\\n(reaches out to fiddle with Monica\\'s hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you\\nThank you. They\\'re yours\\nActually they were Nana\\'s\\nNow I\\'m depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was\\nCentral Perk, the gang are looking at old photos\\nHey, who\\'s this little naked guy\\nThat little naked guy would be me\\nAww, look at the little thing\\nYes, yes, fine, that is my penis.

How \\'bout you\\nGood, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I\\'m not\\nI know. That\\'s what I told her\\nReally\\nYeah\\nSo- you can tell\\nPretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar\\nSo you don\\'t think I have a, a quality\\nSpeaking for my people, I\\'d have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is\\nHe is\\nYup, and waaay out of your league\\nOut of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry\\nTerry, I, I, I know that I haven\\'t worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary\\nAn advance\\nIt\\'s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job\\nRachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You\\'re a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful\\nOk, I, I hear what you\\'re sayin\\'. I\\'m with you. Um, but I, but I\\'m trying really hard. And I think I\\'m doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer\\nExcuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there\\'s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips\\nHuh\\nOk, ok, that\\'s fine. Fine. Hey, I\\'m sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go\\nHey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving\\nNo, they\\'re not\\nYes, they are. The Blymens invited them\\nYou\\'re wrong\\nI am not wrong\\nYou\\'re wrong\\nNo, I just talked to them\\n(getting up, upset) I\\'m calling Mom\\nHey, hey\\nHey\\nHey\\nAnd this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup\\nYes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model\\nThat\\'s so funny, \\'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman\\nWhat were you modeling for\\nYou know those posters for the city free clinic\\nOh, wow, so you\\'re gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"\\nYou know, the asthma guy was really cute\\nDo you know which one you\\'re gonna be\\nNo, but I hear lyme disease is open, so..\\nGood luck, man. I hope you get it\\nThanks\\n(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It\\'s Thanksgiving\\nOk, I\\'ll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I\\'ll make it just like Mom\\'s\\nWill you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps\\nYou know, they\\'re not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I\\'ll work on the lumps. Joey, you\\'re going home, right\\nYeah\\nAnd I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays\\nYes, every single one of them\\nPhoebe, you\\'re gonna be with your grandma\\nYes, and her boyfriend. But we\\'re celebrating Thanksgiving in December \\'cause he is lunar\\nSo you\\'re free Thursday, then\\nYeah. Oh, can I come\\nYeah. Rach, are you thinking you\\'re gonna make it to Vail\\nAbsolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go\\nI thought it was $98.50\\nYeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup\\nWell, I\\'m off to Carol\\'s\\nOoh, ooh! Why don\\'t we invite her\\n(mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she\\'s my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner\\nCarol and Susan\\'s apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters\\nHi, is uh, is Carol here\\nNo, she\\'s at a faculty meeting\\nOh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in\\nThanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum\\nWhat\\'s it look like\\nKinda like a big face without skin\\nYes, I\\'m familiar with the concept. We can just look for it\\nOk. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein\\' a lesbian\\nWell, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don\\'t let you do it\\n(picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic\\nActually, I\\'m reading it to the baby\\nThe uh, the baby that hasn\\'t been born yet? Wouldn\\'t that mean you\\'re... crazy\\nWhat, you don\\'t think they can hear sounds in there\\nYou\\'re not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it\\nYeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice\\nDo you uh, do you talk about me\\nYeah, yeah, all the time\\nReally\\nBut um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there but Rachel\\nLook, if she\\'s talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this\\nOh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we\\'ll all talk, and you\\'ll hear everything we say\\nI\\'d just like to say that I\\'m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I\\'d very much like to butter your head\\nHey, Rach, did you make your money\\nNo, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop\\nRach, here\\'s your mail\\nThanks, you can just put it on the table\\n(insistently) No, here\\'s your mail\\nThanks, you can just put it on the table\\n(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it\\nOh my god, oh, you guys are great\\nWe all chipped in\\n(to Monica) We did\\n(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks\\nThank you. Thank you so much\\n(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin\\'s, and your family size bag of Funyuns\\nWait, wait, Chandler, this is what you\\'re havin\\' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday\\nAll right, I\\'m nine years old\\nOh, I hate this story\\nWe just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they\\'re getting divorced\\nOh my god\\nYes. It\\'s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you\\'ve seen it in reverse\\nThe subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her\\nUh, hi. We uh, we used to work together\\nWe did\\nYeah, at Macy\\'s. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis\\nYeah, right\\nI gotta tell you. You\\'re the best in the business\\nGet out\\nI\\'m serious. You\\'re amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back\\nReally? You don\\'t know what that means to me\\nOoh, you smell great tonight. What\\'re you wearing\\n(provocatively) Nothing\\nListen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something\\nYeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh\\nWhat\\'s wrong\\nI just remembered, I have to do something\\nOh. What\\nUm, leave\\nWait, wait, wait\\nWhat Mario isn\\'t telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City\\nCentral Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang\\nSo I guess you all saw it\\nSaw what\\nNo, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey enters, upset\\nSet another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD\\nTonight, on a very special Blossom\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities\\nMmm, looking good. Ok, cider\\'s mulling, turkey\\'s turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What\\nI don\\'t know. It\\'s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen\\nAll right, that\\'s it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping\\nThat\\'s closer\\nI got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop\\nOh, you must stop shooping\\nOk, I\\'m gonna get my stuff\\nChandler, will you just come in already\\nNo, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment\\nLook out, incoming pumpkin pie\\nOk, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore\\nHey, Monica, I got a question. I don\\'t see any tater tots\\nThat\\'s not a question\\nBut my mom always makes them. It\\'s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It\\'s bad enough I can\\'t be with my family because of my disease\\nAll right, fine. Tonight\\'s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots\\nOk, I\\'m off to talk to my unborn child\\nAh\\nOk, Mom never hit\\n(stirring pot) Ok, all done\\nWhat, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions\\nWhy would we do that\\nWell, \\'cause then they\\'d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died\\nOk, three kinds of potatoes coming up\\nOk, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry\\nThe most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away\\nThe balloon\\nNo, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me\\nI can\\'t, I gotta go\\nCome on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen\\nAlmost never\\nGot the keys? or Got the keys\\nOk\\nCarol and Susan\\'s, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly\\nAnytime you\\'re ready\\nOk, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..\\nJust aim for the bump\\nOk, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can\\'t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid\\nSo don\\'t do it, it\\'s fine. You don\\'t have to do it just because Susan does it\\n(quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the group is coming back from the roof\\nI loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park\\nYeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean\\nOk, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here\\nWe\\'re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys\\nNo I don\\'t\\nYes, you do. When we left, you said, \"got the keys\\nNo I didn\\'t. I asked, \"got the ke-eys\\nNo, no, no, you said, \"got the keys\"\\nDo either of you have the keys\\n(panicked) The oven is on\\nOh, I gotta get my ticket\\nWait, wait, we have a copy of your key\\nWell then get it, get it\\nThat tone will not make me go any faster\\n(angry) Joey\\nThat one will\\nCarol and Susan\\'s, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach\\nAnd everyone\\'s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I\\'m saying, because, let\\'s face it, you\\'re a fetus. You\\'re just happy you don\\'t have gills anymore\\nLook, you don\\'t have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want\\nOh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok\\nHi, how\\'s it goin\\nShh! (singing) Here we come, walkin\\' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that\\nI did\\nDoes it always, uh--\\nNo, no that was the first\\nKeep singing! Keep singing\\n(singing) Hey, hey, you\\'re my baby, and I can\\'t wait to meet you. When you come out I\\'ll buy you a bagel, and then we\\'ll go to the zoo\\nI felt it\\n(singin) Hey, hey, I\\'m your daddy. I\\'m the one without any breasts\\nThe Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock\\nNope, not that one\\nCan you go any faster with that\\nHey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math\\nWhy do you guys have so many keys in there anyway\\n(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this\\n(grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn\\'t for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I\\'m not\\nI swear you said you had the keys\\nNo, I didn\\'t. I wouldn\\'t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn\\'t have the keys\\nOoh, ok, that\\'s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys\\nWhy would I have the keys\\nAside from the fact that you said you had them\\nBut I didn\\'t\\nWell, you should have\\nWhy\\nBecause\\nWhy\\nBecause\\nWhy? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn\\'t it enough that I\\'m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I\\'m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it\\'s my first Thanksgiving, and it\\'s all burned, and, and I... I..\\nOk, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go\\nWell, the turkey\\'s burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined\\nHere we come, walkin\\' down theÑthis doesn\\'t smell like Mom\\'s\\nNo, it doesn\\'t, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one\\nOh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I\\'m stuck here with you guys\\nHey, we all had better plans. This was nobody\\'s first choice\\nOh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner\\nYou call that delicious\\nStop it, stop it, stop it\\nNow this feels like Thanksgiving\\nOoh\\nWhat\\nUgly Naked Guy\\'s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He\\'s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy\\'s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal\\nI\\'ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy\\nOoh, Ugly Naked Dancing\\nIt\\'s nice that he has someone\\nShall I carve\\nBy all means\\nOk, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese\\nI don\\'t even wanna know about the dark cheese\\n(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me\\nOh, I will\\nOoh, you guys have to make a wish\\nMake a wish\\nCome on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What\\'d you wish for\\nThe bigger half\\nI\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked\\nThat\\'s so sweet\\nAnd hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas\\nAnd a crappy New Year\\nHere, here\\nThe Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Ross is entering\\nGuys? There\\'s a somebody I\\'d like you to meet\\nOooh\\nW-wait. What is that\\n\\'That\\' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi\\nNo, no, I don\\'t\\nOh, he is precious! Where did you get him\\nMy friend Bethel rescued him from some lab\\nThat is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel\\nHey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass\\nRoss, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment\\nYeah. I mean, it\\'s been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..\\nWhy don\\'t you just get a roommate\\nNah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that\\'s, that\\'s \\'pathet\\', which is Sanskrit for \\'really cool way to live\\'\\nCentral Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there\\nSo you guys, I\\'m doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother\\'s suicide, and one about a snowman\\nMight wanna open with the snowman\\nHey, Joey. Hey, buddy\\nSo, how\\'d it go\\nAhhhhhh, I didn\\'t get the job\\nHow could you not get it? You were Santa last year\\nI dunno. Some fat guy\\'s sleeping with the store manager. He\\'s not even jolly, it\\'s all political\\nSo what are you gonna be\\nAh, I\\'m gonna be one of his helpers. It\\'s just such a slap in the face, y\\'know\\nHey, do you guys know what you\\'re doing for New Year\\'s? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year\\'s\\nNothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud\\nWell, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I\\'ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you\\nYeah, you wish\\nIt\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner\\nYeah, okay. Alright\\nY\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm\\nWoooo! Yeah\\nPhoebe, you\\'re on\\nOh, oh, good\\n(Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh\\n(Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year\\nNo. No, that\\'s- that\\'s okay\\nWell, c\\'mon, if it\\'s important enough to discuss while I\\'m playing, then I assume it\\'s important enough for everyone else to hear\\n(Quietly, to the others) That guy\\'s going home with a note\\nCould you speak up please\\n(Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I\\'d ever seen in my- in my life\\nDaryl Hannah\\nHard quality\\n-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that\\'s when you started yelling\\nOkay, we\\'re gonna take a short break\\nHey, that guy\\'s going home with more than a note\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas\\nCome here, Marcel. Sit here\\nPheebs, I can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much\\nJust a smidge\\nDavid\\'s like, y\\'know, Scientist Guy. He\\'s very methodical\\nI think it\\'s romantic\\nMe too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman\\nYeah\\nWell, he\\'s kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he\\'s smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..\\nWait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just\\nYeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice\\nWhat?\\nC\\'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact\\nI snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped\\nYeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history\\nI\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped\\nHi. Hi, sorry I\\'m late\\nToo many jokes... must mock Joey\\nNice shoes, huh\\nAah, y\\'killing me\\nRoss! He\\'s playing with my spatulas again\\nOkay, look, he\\'s not gonna hurt them, right\\nDo you always have to bring him here\\nI didn\\'t wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn\\'t mean, and he- he threw some faeces..\\nY\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you\\nOh, that\\'d be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you\\'re there to see him, okay, and you\\'re not like doing it as a favour to me\\nOkay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie\\nMax and David\\'s lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard\\n...But, you can\\'t actually test this theory, because today\\'s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions\\nOkay, alright, I have a question, then\\nYuh\\nUm, were you planning on kissing me ever\\nUh, that\\'s definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, \\'cause it\\'s you\\nSure\\nRight. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we\\'ve reached a place where it\\'s just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I\\'m not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella\\nOh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you\\'re a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist\\'s body\\nRrrreally\\nOh, yeah, oh, I\\'m sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me\\n...Now? Now\\nOh yeah, right now\\nOkay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y\\'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I\\'ll take- this was a gift\\nOkay, now you\\'re just kinda tidying\\nOkay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop\\nI can hop\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there\\nSo tell me something. What does the phrase \\'no date pact\\' mean to you\\nI\\'m sorry, okay. It\\'s just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I\\'d ask Fun Bobby\\nFun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby\\nYeah\\nYou know more than one Fun Bobby\\nI happen to know a Fun Bob\\n(Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..\\nOoh ooh ooh ooh, there\\'s no room for milk\\n(Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is\\nOkay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates\\nUh, four\\nFour\\nFive\\nFive\\nSorry. Paolo\\'s catching an earlier flight\\nYeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What\\'s an elf to do\\nOkay, so I\\'m gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops\\nOh, c\\'mon. We\\'ll have, we\\'ll have a big party, and no-one\\'ll know who\\'s with who\\nHey, y\\'know, this is so not what I needed right now\\nWhat\\'s the matter\\nOh, it\\'s-it\\'s Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y\\'know? He\\'s walking around all the time dragging his hands..\\nThat\\'s so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night\\nReally\\nYeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing\\nWhat, uh... what juggling thing\\nWith the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that\\nNo\\nY\\'know, it wasn\\'t that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..\\nPhoebe. Hi\\nOh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody\\nNo. Have you seen David\\nNo, no, he hasn\\'t been around\\nWell, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk\\nMinsk\\nMinsk. It\\'s in Russia\\nI know where Minsk is\\nWe got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid\\nSo when, when do you leave\\nJanuary first\\nMax and David\\'s lab, they are working\\nHello\\nHey\\nHi\\nHi! (Kisses her) What-what\\'re you doing here\\nUm, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting\\nIt\\'d be even more exciting if we were going\\nOh, you\\'re not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why\\nTell her, David. \\'I don\\'t wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!\\nThank you, Max. Thank you\\nSo-so you\\'re really not going\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do. I just- you decide\\nOh don\\'t do that\\nPlease\\nOh no no\\nOkay, um, stay\\nStay\\nStay\\nGetting so good at that\\nIt was Max\\'s stuff\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the party has started\\nI love this artichoke thing! Oh, don\\'t tell me what\\'s in it, the diet starts tomorrow\\nYou remember Janice\\nVividly\\nHi\\nHi, I\\'m Sandy\\nSandy! Hi! C\\'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids\\nYeah. That\\'s okay, right\\nPar-tay\\nThat thing is not coming in here\\n\\'That thing\\'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn\\'t be welcome in your home\\nI\\'m guessing your new girlfriend wouldn\\'t urinate on my coffee table\\nOkay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened..\\nAlright. Just keep him away from me\\nThank you. (She walks off) C\\'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I\\'ll, uh... catch up with you later\\nOh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where\\'s Paolo\\nRome. Jerk missed his flight\\nAnd then... your face is bloated\\nNo. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I\\'m blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I\\'m going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip\\nY\\'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf\\nWow, that\\'s, uh, dirty\\nYeah\\nHey, kids..\\n(Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I\\'m not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in\\n(Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me\\n(Imitating) But you found me\\nHere, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You\\'re on Janice Camera\\nKill me. Kill me now\\nHey everybody! It\\'s Fun Bobby\\nHey, sorry I\\'m late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn\\'t get a flight out \\'til tomorrow, so here I am\\n(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died\\nIt\\'s gonna be an open casket, y\\'know, so at least I\\'ll- I get to see him again\\n(Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I\\'m gonna blow this one up, and I\\'m gonna write \\'Reunited\\' in glitter\\nAlright, Janice, that\\'s it!

(Monica whispers in Joey\\'s ear\\nWaitÑohÑheyÑhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don\\'t know\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m just excited about being an aunt\\nOr an uncle..\\nHey Phoebe\\nHi Pheebs\\nPheebs\\nFine\\nPhoebe, what\\'s the matter\\nNothing, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just, I\\'m out of sorts\\nHey, can we get some cappuccino over here\\nOh, right, that\\'s me\\nHey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on\\nFine\\nPhoebe, what is it\\nAll right, you know Paolo\\nI\\'m familiar with his work, yes..\\nWell, he made a move on me\\nWhoa, store will be open tomorrow\\nMore coffee over here, please\\nCentral Perk, continued from earlier\\nWell, what happened\\nWell, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe\\'s legs\\nMy God\\nAre you sure\\nOh yeah, I\\'m sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren\\'t the problem anymore\\nWas it...\\nOh, boy scouts could have camped under there\\nOooooo...\\n\"Ooo,\" what\\nUma Thurman\\nOh\\nThe actress\\nThanks Rach\\nSo what are you gonna do\\nYou have to tell her! You have to tell her! It\\'s your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it\\'s a feminist issue! Guys? Guys\\nOh, yeah, you have to tell her\\nFeminist issue. That\\'s where I went\\nShe is gonna hate me\\nThe Table Store, Joey and Chandler and looking for their new table\\nWill you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one\\nThat\\'s patio furniture\\nSo what, like people are gonna come in and think, \"Uh-oh, I\\'m outside again?\" Of course\\n(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds\\nI don\\'t know, birds just don\\'t say, \"Hello, sit here, eat something\\nYou pick one\\nAll right, how about the ladybugs\\nOh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining\\nFine, you want to get the birds, get the birds\\nNot like that, I won\\'t! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel folding and packing clothes in suitcases as Phoebe enters\\nHey\\nHi Pheebs\\nAre you moving out\\nNo, these aren\\'t all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one\\'s Paolo\\'s\\nUm, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec\\nWell, sure...just a sec, though, \\'cause Paolo\\'s on his way over\\nOh\\nOh, Pheebs, Pheebs..\\nOk, um, (clears throat) we haven\\'t known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world\\n(taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?\\nAll right, well, you\\'re right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I\\'ve ever had\\nWhich proves that I never lie\\nI guess you don\\'t\\nPaolo made a pass at me\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Ross, Chandler, Joey, and Monica admiring their new table\\nSo, what do you think\\nI think It\\'s the most beautiful table I\\'ve ever seen\\nI know\\nSo how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys\\' heads\\nWho cares, we\\'ll eat at the sink! Come on, let\\'s play\\nHeads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel is recovering from the shock\\nAre you okay\\nI need some milk\\nOk, I\\'ve got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better\\nNo...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \"Oh, Paolo, he\\'s so great, he makes me feel so...\" Oh, God, I\\'m so embarrassed\\nI\\'m so embarrassed, I\\'m the one he hit on\\nPheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened\\nI\\'m so sorry! No I\\'m sorry! No I\\'m sorry! No I\\'m sorry\\nNo, wait, oh, what are we sorry about\\nI don\\'t know...right, he\\'s the pig\\nSuch a pig\\nOh he\\'s like a..\\nHe\\'s like a big disgusting..\\n...like a..\\n...pig...pig man\\nYes, good! Ok..\\n(voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this\\n(raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It\\'s because... he\\'s gorgeous, and he\\'s charming, and when he looks at you..\\nOk, Ok, Pheebs..\\nThe end\\nOh, God..\\nShould I not have told you\\nNo, no, trust, me, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as the foosball game continues\\nI think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo\\'s over there right now, so..\\nWe should get over there and see if she\\'s okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on\\n(wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts\\nNo-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team\\nCome on, two on one\\nWhat are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it\\'s time for you to swoop in\\nWhat, now\\nYes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She\\'s gotta know that you\\'re everything he\\'s not! You\\'re like, like the anti-Paolo\\nMy Catholic friend is right. She\\'s distraught. You\\'re there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s Balcony, Rachel is throwing Paolo\\'s clothes over the side\\nNo, that\\'s cold, that\\'s cold, that\\'s..\\n(entering) How\\'s it going\\nDon\\'t stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there\\'s just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, \"How could you?\" or, \"Enormous breasts!\" Here he comes\\nOoh\\nUh, I am, uh, to say good-bye\\nOh, ok bye-bye\\nPaolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles\\nGrazie\\nPaolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say..\\nOh, just look at her..\\nOh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she\\'s not overwhelmed..\\nOh, you\\'re right\\n(pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me\\nHey\\nHey\\nYou all right\\nOoh, I\\'ve been better..\\nCome here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you\\nOh, Ross..\\nWhat\\nI am so sick of guys. I don\\'t want to look at another guy, I don\\'t want to think about another guy, I don\\'t even want to be near another guy\\nHuh\\nOh Ross, you\\'re so great\\nOoh...hey honey, are you all right\\nOh..\\nYou ok\\n...medium...hmm...any cookies left\\nYep\\nSee, Rach, uh, see, I don\\'t think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don\\'t. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process\\nNo. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know\\nUh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo\\nNo, I know, I know, and I\\'m sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one\\n(astonished) What\\nWhat\\nI-I\\'m, I\\'m having a boy\\nUh...no. No, no, in fact, you\\'re not having a boy\\nWha-I\\'m having, I\\'m having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy\\nYes, you\\'re having a boy\\nI\\'m having a boy! Oh, I\\'m having a boy\\nWhat is it\\nI\\'m having a boy! I-I\\'m having a boy\\nHey\\nHey\\nWe already knew that\\nI\\'m having a son. Um..\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball\\nYes! And that would be a shut-down\\nShut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms\\nWhere are you guys going? Come on, one more game\\nUh, it\\'s 2:30 in the morning\\nYeah, get out\\nYou guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I\\'ll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I\\'m going, (they throw her out) and I\\'m gone\\n(to Joey) One more game\\nOh yeah\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler walks in and starts raiding the fridge. Then Rachel comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped round her waist, drying herself with another towel. Chandler and Rachel startle each other and she drops the towel for a second and snatches the rug off the couch\\nThat is it\\nI\\'m sorry\\nYou have no respect for anybody\\'s privacy\\nRachel, wait, wait\\nNo, you wait! This is ridiculous\\nCan I just say one thing\\nWhat? What?\\nThat\\'s a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas\\nOh!\\nCentral Perk, Phoebe is there with her boyfriend Roger, talking to Rachel and Monica\\nOh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y\\'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower\\nThat\\'s pretty much it\\nOops\\nBut you tell it really well, sweetie\\nThanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you\\nOkay. I\\'ll miss you\\nIsn\\'t he great\\nHe\\'s so cute! And he seems to like you so much\\nI know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he\\'s not too shrinky, y\\'know\\nSo, you think you\\'ll do it on his couch\\nOh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. I think that\\'s a little weird, y\\'know? Vinyl\\nOkaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else\\nOh, yes, could I have one of those\\nNo, I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of those. Anybody else\\nOkay\\nDid I, uh, did I miss something\\nNo, she\\'s still upset because I saw her boobies\\nYou what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies\\nIt was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts\\nOkay, okay, could we change the subject, please\\nYeah, \\'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts\\nOkay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change\\nY\\'know, I don\\'t know why you\\'re so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies\\nNice? They were nice. I mean, that\\'s it? I mean, mittens are nice\\nOkaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me\\nYou\\'re so funny! He\\'s really funny! I wouldn\\'t wanna be there when when the laughter stops\\nWhoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What\\'d you mean by that\\nOh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y\\'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance\\nHuh\\nI mean hey! I just met you, I don\\'t know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty\\nUhhuh, how did you know that\\nIt\\'s textbook\\nHey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right\\nHey! Hey, Mr. Trib\\nHey, how long are you in the city\\nJust for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I\\'m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I don\\'t know this one\\nOh, this is my friend Roger\\nHi\\nHey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger\\nYou too, sir\\n(To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy\\nDad, dad\\nOh, \\'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how\\'s the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler\\'s shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone\\nGotta go\\n(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn\\'t Ma\\nHer name\\'s Ronni. She\\'s a pet mortician\\nSure. So how long you been..\\nRemember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships\\nSince then?\\nNo, it\\'s only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you\\'d know that I wasn\\'t always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y\\'ever been in love\\n...I d\\'know\\nThen y\\'haven\\'t. You\\'re burning your tomatoes\\nYou\\'re one to talk\\nJoe, your dad\\'s in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it\\'s with two different women\\nOh man. Please tell me one of \\'em is Ma\\nOf course, course one of \\'em\\'s Ma. What\\'s the matter with you\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad\\'s affair\\nIt\\'s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He\\'s like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That\\'d be cool.... This blows\\nI know, I mean, why can\\'t parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can\\'t you stop staring at my breasts\\n(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What\\nDid you not get a good enough look the other day\\nAlright, alright. We\\'re all adults here, there\\'s only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you\\'re gonna have to show her your peepee\\nY\\'know, I don\\'t see that happening\\nC\\'mon, he\\'s right. Tit for tat\\nWell I\\'m not showing you my \\'tat\\nHello\\n(Intercom) It\\'s Phoebe\\n(Intercom) And Rog\\nC\\'mon up\\n(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here\\nWhat\\'s the matter with Rog\\nYeah\\nOh, it\\'s nothing, it\\'s a little thing... I hate that guy\\nWhat, so he was a little analytical. That\\'s what he does, y\\'know? C\\'mon, he\\'s not that bad\\nY\\'see, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian\\nI dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail\\nWhy? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you..\\nWait-wait, go back to that sibling thing\\nWell, I don\\'t know. I mean, it\\'s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents\\nThat that\\'s ridiculous! I don\\'t feel guilty for her failures\\nOh! So you think I\\'m a failure\\nIsn\\'t he good\\nNonono, thatthat\\'s not what I was saying..\\nY\\'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they\\'d keep liking you better\\nHey, I married a lesbian to make you look good\\nYou\\'re right! I mean you\\'re right! It wasn\\'t just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles\\' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in\\nThat\\'s tough. Tough stuff. C\\'mon, Pheebs, we\\'re gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going\\nOh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, \\'kay\\nGeez, we\\'re gonna be late, sweetie..\\nOh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon\\nYou\\'re welcome\\nListen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they\\'re just food, they\\'re not love\\nHate that guy\\nThe Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel\\'s\\nNight, you guys\\nOh look, it\\'s the woman we ordered\\nHey. Can, uh, can we help you\\nOh, no thanks, I\\'m just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani\\nI\\'m Joey Tribbiani\\nOh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you\\'re so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I\\'m, I\\'m Ronni....Cheese Nip\\nUh, Joey\\'s having an embolism, but I\\'d go for a Nip, y\\'know\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey\\'s dad is not around\\nNow, y\\'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want \\'em sorta laid out like they\\'re sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee\\nJoey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys\\nThat\\'s a good one\\nHey, Joe\\nDad, Ronni\\'s here\\nHuh\\nHi\\nHey! Hello, babe! Wh what\\'re what\\'re you doing here\\nOh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you\\'d need it tomorrow for your meeting\\nThank you. Uh..\\nSo, who\\'s up for a big game of Kerplunk\\nLook, I uh, I shouldn\\'ta come. I-I\\'d better get going, I don\\'t wanna miss the last train\\nI don\\'t want you taking that thing\\nOh, where\\'m I gonna stay, here\\nWho-ah-ho\\nWe\\'ll go to a hotel\\n(Shrugs) We\\'ll go to a hotel\\nNo you won\\'t\\nNo we won\\'t\\nIf you go to a hotel you\\'ll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you\\nYou\\'re gonna keep an eye on us\\nThat\\'s right, mister, and I don\\'t care how old you are, as long as you\\'re under my roof you\\'re gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend\\nWow. He\\'s strict\\nNow dad, you\\'ll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler\\'s room\\nThanks. You\\'re, uh, you\\'re a good kid\\nC\\'mon, I\\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\\'s not followed by \"No thanks, it\\'s late\\nOkay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough\\nWhat kinda change\\nI can\\'t do that\\nThen you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right\\nI don\\'t wanna hear it! Now go to my room\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the living room. Joey is restless\\nHey, Kicky. What\\'re you doing\\nJust trying to get comfortable. I can\\'t sleep in my underwear\\nWell, you\\'re gonna\\nI\\'ve been thinking. Y\\'know, about how I\\'m always seeing girls on top of girls..\\nAre they end to end, or tall like pancakes\\nY\\'know what I mean, about how I\\'m always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I\\'d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y\\'know? Now I\\'m looking at my dad, thinking..\\nHey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave\\nNo\\nNo. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married\\nYou really think so\\nYeah. I really do\\nThanks, Chandler\\nGet off\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it\\nHi\\nHi...May I help you\\nYeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler\\'s in ours\\nOkay...who are you\\nOh, I\\'m Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress\\nOh, c\\'mon in\\nThanks\\nHi, I\\'m Rachel\\nHi\\nBathroom\\'s up there\\nGreat\\nHey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler\\'s been in the shower\\nOh, like, uh, five minutes\\nPerfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it\\'s peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler\\'s apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib\\nHey. Morning, dear\\nChandler Bing? It\\'s time to see your thing\\n(Runs out in a towel) What\\'s the matter with you?\\nI thought it was Chandler\\n(Comes out of his room) What? What\\nYou were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing\\nSorry, my my thing was in there with me\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters\\nHey, Pheebs\\nHey\\nHow\\'s it going\\nGood. Oh oh! Roger\\'s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys\\nSo what\\'s going on\\nNothing, um, it\\'s just, um... It\\'s Roger\\nI dunno, there\\'s just something about..\\nBasically we just feel that he\\'s..\\nWe hate that guy\\nYeah. Hate him\\nWe\\'re sorry, Pheebs, we\\'re sorry\\nUh-huh. Okay. Okay, don\\'t you think, maybe, though, it\\'s just that he\\'s so perceptive that it freaks you out\\n...No, we hate him\\nWe\\'re sorry\\nChandler and Joey\\'s apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him\\nMa! What\\'re you doing here\\nI came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this\\nOww! Big ring\\nWhy did you have to fill your father\\'s head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There\\'s chicken in there, put it away. For God\\'s sake, Joey, really\\nHold on, you-you knew\\nOf course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should\\'ve heard some of his cover stories. \"I\\'m sleeping over at my accountant\\'s,\" I mean, what is that? Please\\nSo then how could you I mean, how could you?\\nDo you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he\\'s happy! I mean, it\\'s nice, he has a hobby\\nMa, I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you\\nMe? I\\'m fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there\\'d be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I\\'ll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he\\'s been so ashamed of himself that he\\'s been more attentive, he\\'s been more loving... I mean, it\\'s like every day\\'s our anniversary\\nI\\'m...happy...for you\\nWell don\\'t be, because now everything\\'s screwed up. I just want it the way it was\\nMa, I\\'m sorry. I just did what I thought you\\'d want\\nI know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her\\nYeah. You\\'re ten times prettier than she is\\nThat\\'s sweet. Could I take her\\nWith this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest\\nCentral Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger\\nWhat\\'s wrong, sweetie\\nNothing, nothing\\nAaaah, what\\'s wrong, c\\'mon. (Pats his leg\\nIt\\'s, I mean, it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. It\\'s my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don\\'t\\nOh. They don\\'t\\nBut they don\\'t see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don\\'t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you\\'re a little..\\nWhat\\nIntense and creepy\\nOh\\nBut I don\\'t. Me, Phoebe\\nWell, I\\'m not I\\'m not at all surprised they feel that way\\nYou\\'re not? See, that\\'s why you\\'re so great\\nActually it\\'s, it\\'s quite, y\\'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y\\'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I\\'m sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you\\'re like all \\'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!\\'\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments\\nSo you talked to your dad, huh\\nYeah. He\\'s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she\\'s gonna keep pretending she doesn\\'t know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can\\'t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today\\nWow\\nThings sure have changed here on Waltons mountain\\nSo Joey, you okay\\nYeah, I guess. It\\'s just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you\\'ve gotta let them make their own mistakes\\nJust think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them\\nIf I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom\\n(entering) Hey\\nHey, Pheebs\\nHow\\'s it going\\nOh, okay, except I broke up with Roger\\nAwww\\nYeah, right\\nAaawwwwww!\\nWhat happened\\nI don\\'t know, I mean, he\\'s a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it\\'s just... I hate that guy\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters\\nHey, Joey. What\\'s going on\\nClear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom\\nJoey!! What the hell were you doing?\\nSorry. Wrong boobies\\nHello, Joey\\nOh! ...Hello, dear\\nCentral Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it\\nI\\'m tellin\\' you Ross, she wants you\\nShe barely knows me. We just live in the same building\\nAny contact\\nShe lent me an egg once\\nYou\\'re in\\nAw, right\\nHi, Ross\\nHey\\nCome on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÑI don\\'t think we need a third..\\nExcuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks\\nAn egg\\nYeah, you\\'re gonna go up to her and say, \"Here\\'s your egg back, I\\'m returning your egg\\nI think it\\'s winning\\nI think it\\'s insane\\nShe\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend\\nThink it\\'ll work\\nNo, it\\'s suicide. The man\\'s got an egg\\nCentral Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still talking to the beautiful woman\\nYou can not do this\\nDo what, do what\\nRoger wants to take her out tomorrow night\\nNo! Phoebes! Don\\'t you remember why you dumped the guy\\n\\'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it\\'s nice to have a date on Valentine\\'s Day\\nBut Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do\\nWell, what are you guys doing tomorrow night\\nActually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes\\nOh, uh, listen, about tonight..\\nNo, no, no, don\\'t you dare bail on me. The only reason she\\'s goin\\' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend\\nYes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..\\nPathetic mess? I know, butÑcome on, man, she\\'s needy, she\\'s vulnerable. I\\'m thinkin\\', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks.

Joey and Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one another\\nYou know, ever since I was little, I\\'ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes\\nGood for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters\\nBy the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads\\nThat\\'s OK\\nOh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty\\n(to Lorraine) We can\\'t do that\\n(disgusted) What? What can\\'t you do\\nUh, can I talk to you for a second, over there\\nUh, we might be leaving now\\nTell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we\\nShe said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.

You\\'re right\\n(to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please\\nI\\'m outta here. Here\\'s my credit card. Dinner\\'s on me. I\\'m sorry, Chandler\\nI hope she throws up on you\\nSo..\\nJust us\\nOh, what a crappy night\\nAlthough, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt\\'s been stickin\\' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom\\nExcuse me.

He\\'s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV\\nI will go for that drink\\nYou got it. Good woman!

How did you know\\nA Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date\\nI\\'m just sayin\\' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn\\'t just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half\\nThat\\'s funny. Who are they\\nThe blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend\\nYou mean they\\'re lovers\\nIf you wanna put a label on it\\nWow, uh, anything else I should know\\nNope, nope, that\\'s it\\nOh, and she\\'s pregnant with my baby.

Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn\\'t even my major\\nOh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you\\nI thought they could...I\\'ll try to get back as soon as I can. I\\'m sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically\\nNow that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? \\'Cause she\\'s, she\\'s alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad\\n(reluctantly) I guess\\nAre you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us\\nOh, no no no. I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine\\nCome on. These people\\'ll scooch down. You guys\\'ll scooch, won\\'t you? Let\\'s try scooching! Come on. Come on.

And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn\\'t even her major\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of control\\nWhat do we got there\\nA piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureÑWow, that guy\\'s hairier than the Chief\\nYou know, it\\'s a really funny story how this happened\\nIt\\'s all right. It\\'s all right. You don\\'t have to explain. This isn\\'t the first boyfriend bonfire that we\\'ve seen get out of control\\nYou\\'re our third call tonight\\nReally\\nOh, sure, Valentine\\'s is our busiest night of the year\\nCentral Perk\\nI brought you something\\nIs it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever\\nI had them made special\\nOk, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there\\'s no way for me to tell you this. At least there\\'s no new way for me to tell you this. I just don\\'t things are gonna work out\\nThat\\'s fine\\n(surprised) It is\\nMmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn\\'t the end\\nOh no, you see, actually it is\\nNo, it isn\\'t, because you won\\'t let that happen. Don\\'t you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing\\nOh, no I don\\'t\\nWell then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year\\'s? Who invited who? Valentine\\'s? Who asked who into whose bed\\nI did, but..\\nYou seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can\\'t live without me. And you know it. You just don\\'t know you know it. See ya\\nCall me\\nThe Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there\\nIt\\'s not true. I never called your mother a wolverine\\nYou did so. I swear, I swearÑ(noticing Kristin\\'s absence) How long has she been in the bathroom\\nUh, I don\\'t think she\\'s in the bathroom. Her coat is gone\\nWell maybe it\\'s cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years\\nThat could be it\\nOh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it\\nMushroom. Smile. They won\\'t all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner\\nNo, it\\'s just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she\\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\\'s, that\\'s it. And um, and then I\\'m here talkin\\' to you, and, and it\\'s easy, and it\\'s fun, and, and I don\\'t, I don\\'t have to...You know, here\\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you\\'re gonna say, you\\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let\\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\\'re great together, you know. You can\\'t deny it. Besides, you\\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin\\' that, but there\\'s somethin\\' right here. I love you\\nOh, I love you too. But..\\nNo but, no but\\nYou know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It\\'s time to take the pin out. You\\'ll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you\\nThat\\'s easy for you to say, you found one already\\nAll you need is a woman who likes men and you\\'ll be set\\nNot her\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, The girls are talking with the firemen\\nWe get off around midnight, why don\\'t we pick you up then\\nSo, um, will you bring the truck\\nI\\'ll even let you ring the bell\\nOh, my god\\nSee, there you go, the cleansing works\\nThey\\'re nice guys\\nOh, they\\'re firemen guys\\nOut in the hall, the firemen are talking\\nYou guys tell them you were married\\nNo way\\nAre you kidding? My girlfriend doesn\\'t know, I\\'m not gonna tell them\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is serving Joey, Ross, and Monica their drinks\\n(to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him\\nThank you\\n(to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him\\nGrazie\\nAnd a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her\\nAww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach\\nYeah\\nWhy does my cinamon stick have an eraser\\nOh! That\\'s why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I\\'m sorry\\nChandler\\'s job, Chandler is typing data into his computer, he keeps typing even while taking a drink of coffee with one hand. One of his co-workers walks by\\nChandler\\nMrs. Tedlock. You\\'re looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you\\nYes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day\\nOh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly\\nHey you guys! Chandler\\'s coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..\\nHey\\nHey\\nNever mind. But it was going to be really good\\nWhat\\'s going on\\nWhat is it\\nSo, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor\\nThat\\'s great\\nSo.... I quit\\nWhy\\nWhy? This was supposed to be a temp job\\nYeah, Chandler... you\\'ve been there for five years\\nIf I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do\\nSo was it a lot more money\\nIt doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS\\n... the WENUS\\nWeekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term\\n(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS\\nSo what\\'re you going to do\\nI don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do. I just know I\\'m not going to figure it out working there\\nOooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he\\'s opening up a restaurant and he\\'s looking for a head chef\\n(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there\\nHi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You\\'re a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler\\'s the one who needs a job right now, so...\\nYeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant\\n(to Monica\\'s tapping) Yeah, yeah\\nWell, what kind of food is he looking for\\nWell, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he\\'s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu\\n(excited) Oh my God\\nYeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think\\nThanks, Phoebe. But I just don\\'t really see myself in a big white hat\\nOK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit\\nCan you see my nipples through this shirt\\nNo. But don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure they\\'re still there\\nWhere are you going, Mr. Suity-Man\\nWell, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the \"a-gogo\\nCareer counselor\\nHey, you guys all know what you want to do\\nI don\\'t\\nHey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don\\'t have a dream\\nAh, the lesser-known \"I don\\'t have a dream\" speech\\nOh, I love my life, I love my life\\nOoh! Brian\\'s Song\\nThe meeting with the guy went great\\nSo great! He showed me where the restaurant\\'s going to be. It\\'s this, it\\'s this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right\\nWas it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears\\nSo anyway, I\\'m cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can \\'ooh\\' and \\'ahh\\' and make yummy noises\\nWhat are you going to make\\n(as though Rachel wasn\\'t paying attention) Yummy noises\\n(pause) And Monica, what are you going to make\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. It\\'s just going to be so great\\nOoh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn\\'t know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don\\'t know\\nHey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood\\nHow about Tony\\'s? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it\\'s free\\nOK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you\\'re not dating a puma\\nWho are you going out with\\nOh, is this the bug lady\\n(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross\\nHer name is Celia. She\\'s not a bug lady. She\\'s curator of insects at the museum\\nSo what are you guys going to do\\nOh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I\\'d introduce her to my monkey\\nAnd he\\'s not speaking metaphorically\\n(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh\\nWell, I don\\'t know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I\\'m hoping (gestures) huh-huh\\nI\\'m telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She\\'s going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it\\'ll seal the deal\\nRoss\\'s apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia\\'s hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off\\nCelia, don\\'t worry!Ê Don\\'t scream!Ê He\\'s not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..\\nI can\\'t stand this! He\\'s got his claws in my..\\nAlright..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making food, and having everyone try it\\n(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse\\n(tasting) Mmmm. Good\\nIs it better than the other salmon mousse\\nIt\\'s creamier\\nYeah, well, is that better\\nI don\\'t know. We\\'re talking about whipped fish, Monica. I\\'m just happy I\\'m keeping it down, y\\'know\\nMy God! What happened to you\\nEight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation\\nThat\\'s so great! \\'Cause you already know how to do that\\nCan you believe it? I mean, don\\'t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something\\n(comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt\\n(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this\\'ll cheer you up\\nOoh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I\\'d better split this with you\\nIt\\'s supposed to be that small. It\\'s a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche\\n(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing..\\n(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o\\'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I\\'ll see you then. Bye\\nTen dollars an hour for what\\nOh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she\\'d help me out\\n(hurt) Waitressing\\nUh-oh\\nWell... of course I thought of you! But... but..\\nBut, but\\nBut, you see, it\\'s just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy\\'s more of a... professional waitress\\nOh! I see. And I\\'ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics\\nYou know, I don\\'t mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in \\'76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche\\nRoss\\' apartment, Girl, You\\'ll Be A Woman Soon (the original, not that cruddy Urge Overkill version) is playing. Ross and Celia are kissing passionately\\nTalk to me\\nOK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..\\nNo no no. Talk... dirty\\n(embarrassed) Wha... what, here\\nYes..\\nAh...\\nSay something..... hot\\n(panicked) Er.... um....\\nWhat\\nUm... uh.... vulva\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last night\\n(in disbelief) Vulva\\nAlright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn\\'t a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling\\n(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?\\nShut up! It was nice. I just... I don\\'t think I\\'m the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know\\nWhat\\'s the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I\\'ll tell you what. Just try something on me\\n(deadpan) Please be kidding\\nWhy not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you\\'d like to be doing right now\\nOK. (closes eyes) I\\'m in my apartment..\\n....yeah... what else\\nThat\\'s it. I\\'m in my apartment, you\\'re not there, we\\'re not having this conversation\\n(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I\\'ll start, OK\\nJoey, please\\nCome on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!

You like this woman, right\\nYeah\\nYou want to see her again, right\\nSure\\nWell if you can\\'t talk dirty to me, how\\'re you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt\\nOK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don\\'t want you staring at me when I\\'m doing this\\n(turning around) Alright, alright. I\\'m around. Go ahead\\nAhem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips\\nThere you go! Keep going. Keep going\\nI, er..\\nI want to take my tongue... and..\\n....and...\\nSay it... say it\\n...run it all over your body until you\\'re... trembling with... with..\\n(smiling)....with?\\n(rushing to explain) Funny story\\nYou\\'re not going to believe this\\nIt\\'s OK. It\\'s OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together\\nHey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again\\nAgain\\nAnd again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again\\n(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How\\'s life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it\\'s a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that\\'s very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn\\'t about the money. I need something that\\'s more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that\\'s on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I\\'m not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I\\'m telling you, you\\'ve got the wrong guy! You\\'ve got the wrong guy! (Listens) I\\'ll see you on Monday\\nChandler\\'s new window office, he is showing Phoebe around\\nWell\\n(excited) Wow! It\\'s huge!

That guy\\'s peeing\\n(walks away from window) OK, that\\'s enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down\\n(sitting) OK\\nThis is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment\\nThank you Helen, that\\'ll be all\\nLast time I do that, I promise\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is on the phone. Rachel walks in and overhears the conversation\\n(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy\\nWho was that\\nWendy bailed. I have no waitress\\nOh... that\\'s too bad. Bye bye\\nTen dollars an hour\\nNo\\nTwelve dollars an hour\\nMon. I wish I could, but I\\'ve made plans to walk around\\nYou know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn\\'t buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour\\nDone\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking. Phoebe walks in with Steve (Crystal Duck winner Jon Lovitz)\\nWell hello! Welcome to Monica\\'s. May I take your coat\\nHi Steve\\nHello, Monica.

Would you like a tour\\nI was just being polite, but, alright\\nWhat\\'s up\\n(whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie\\nWhat\\nSmoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja\\nOK, OK. I\\'m with you, Cheech. OK\\n(from the living room) Is it dry in here\\nLet me, let me get you some wine\\nYeah, I think we\\'re ready for our first course.

(he finishes)... ginger\\nWell, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic\\nI\\'m so glad you liked them\\nLike \\'em? I could eat a hundred of them\\nOh, well... um, that\\'s all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we\\'ll be serving some delicious onion tartlets\\nTartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning\\nExcuse me? Can I help you with anything\\nYou know, I don\\'t know what I\\'m looking for\\n(from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells!

In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all\\nThatÕs unbelievable\\nAnd yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others\\nI see.

Rachel and Monica enter, looking worried. As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile, while Monica struggles to smile at all\\n(as Monica) Hi, remember us\\n(Grimacing) Mmm hmmm\\n(as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again.

Say all of his relationships are affected by this\\nDo you have a point\\nYou know, you think I would\\nWhat\\'s up with the simian\\nIt\\'s just a fur ball\\nOkay...

Where\\'s where\\'s my \\'K\\'\\nThe Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in Ross\\'s arms. They dash up to the admissions desk.

Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa\\n(as Ursula) Hey\\nUrse..\\n..ah, what\\'re you doing here?

Y\\'know, that\\'s a tough hand to beat\\n(to Ross): I thought we had them\\nOh, well, when you don\\'t have the cards, you don\\'t have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica\\'s apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane\\nAirplane! Airport! Airport \\'75! Airport \\'77! Airport \\'79\\nOh, time\\'s up\\n(pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE\\nOh\\nThat\\'s a bird\\nThat\\'s a bird\\nOK, OK, it\\'s my turn\\nGo\\nUh.... bean! Bean\\n(triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being\\nYes\\nThat, you get? That, you get\\nThe credits list two characters, Tia and Samantha, who I assume are the sweaty women Joey and Chandler meet. However, I don\\'t know which is which, so I\\'ve simply called them Woman #1 and Woman #2\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer\\nOkay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there\\'s one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You\\'re not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay\\nCentral Perk, Monica enters with some mail\\nMail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven\\nThank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee\\nOh good! \\'Cause where else would we get any\\nOh. Right. ...Oh great\\nWhat is it\\nCountry club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for \\'inspiration.\\' Oh my God! Oh my God, it\\'s Barry and Mindy\\nBarry who you almost...\\nBarry who I almost\\nAnd Mindy, your maid of...\\nMindy, my maid of. Oh\\n(Takes it) That\\'s Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel\\'s look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese\\nMarcel. Bring me the rice, c\\'mon. Bring me the rice, c\\'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C\\'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he\\'s finally mastered the difference between \\'bring me the\\' and \\'pee in the\\'. (Rachel ignores him) \\'Bring me the\\' and- Rach\\nWhat\\nHi\\nOh, I\\'m sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I\\'m happy for them\\nReally\\nNo. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody\\nWhoah, uh, what happened to, uh, \\'Forget relationships! I\\'m done with men!\\' The whole, uh, penis embargo\\nOh, I don\\'t know. I guess it\\'s not about no guys, it\\'s about the right guy, y\\'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that\\'s all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..\\nWait-wait. I, I got it. I was there\\nWell, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y\\'know? Someone who\\'s like, who\\'s like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl\\nYes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it\\'s funny, very often, someone who you wouldn\\'t think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..\\nHi\\n...Gets interrupted. Hi\\nHi, how was the movie\\nWonderful\\nSo good\\nSuck-fest\\nToootal chick-flick\\nI-I\\'m sorry it wasn\\'t one of those movies with, like, y\\'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast..\\nHey, I don\\'t need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there\\'s a little nudity\\nThere was nudity\\nI meant female nudity. Alright? I don\\'t need to see Lou Grant frolicking\\nHugh! Hugh Grant\\nAlright, I\\'ve gotta go. C\\'mon, Marcel! C\\'mon! We\\'re gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren\\'t we? Yes, we are\\nThey\\'re still just friends, right\\n(To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow\\nThat\\'s right, you\\'re gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel\\'s, aren\\'t you\\nOh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this\\n\\'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?\\' Oh, unclench. You\\'re not even gonna be there\\nJoe-G\\'s Pizza, the guys are there\\nI can\\'t believe we are even having this discussion\\nI agree. I\\'m, like, in disbelief\\nI mean, don\\'t you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would\\'ve happened already\\nI\\'m telling you, she said she\\'s looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me\\nShe really said that\\nWell, I added the \\'exactly like me\\' part... But she said she\\'s looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight\\n\\'Tonight\\' tonight\\nWell, I think it\\'s perfect. Y\\'know, it\\'s just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..\\nI can\\'t remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey\\nAnyway, I figured after work I\\'d go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her\\nHey, y\\'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890\\'s, when that phrase was last used\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a soap opera\\nNow, now the one in the feather boa, that\\'s Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there\\'s Raven. We hate her. We\\'re glad she\\'s dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica\\'s shoes? You know you\\'re not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I\\'m sure you didn\\'t register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm\\'s length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c\\'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn\\'t Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel\\nHow could you lose him\\nI don\\'t know\\nWait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one\\nI don\\'t know. The left one\\nWhich ones\\nOh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything\\n(Entering) Hey\\nHi\\nWhoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative\\nRachel lost Marcel\\nOh no, how\\nHe- he pooped in my shoe\\nWhich one\\nThose cute little black ones I wear all the time\\nNo, which one? The right or left? \\'Cause the left one is lucky..\\nC\\'mon, you guys, what\\'re we gonna do, what\\'re we gonna do\\nAlright alright. You\\'re a monkey. You\\'re loose in the city. Where do you go\\nOkay, it\\'s his first time out, so he\\'s probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I\\'ll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room\\nOh, my, God, c\\'mon, you guys! He\\'s gonna be home any minute! He\\'s gonna kill me\\nOkay, we\\'ll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I\\'ll take third and fourth\\nWell, what\\'m I gonna do? What\\'m I gonna do\\nOkay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you\\nAnybody wanna trade? Oh..\\nWhaddyou want\\nMr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it\\nI left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it\\nNo\\nWhy would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall\\nI wasn\\'t ready for it\\nA monkey. Have you seen a monkey\\nSaw Regis Philbin once..\\nOkay, thank you, Mr. Heckles\\nYou owe me a waffle\\n(On the phone) Okay, he\\'s a, he\\'s a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks\\nHey. How did, uh, how\\'d it go today\\nGreat! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine\\nYeah. You, uh, you want some\\nOh, I would love some. But y\\'know what? Y\\'know what? Let\\'s not drink it here. I\\'m feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark\\nUh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y\\'know how we were, uh, y\\'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff\\nOh God, Ross, I cannot do this\\nOkay, quick and painful\\nOh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don\\'t hate me\\nOh, what? What-what\\nY\\'know Marcel\\n...Yeah\\nWell, I kind of... I kind of lost him\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, continued from earlier\\n(Angry) I- I- I ca- I can\\'t believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment\\nNo, y\\'know what, I guess it\\'s partially my fault. Y\\'know, I shouldn\\'t\\'ve, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should\\'ve started you off with like a pen or a pencil\\n(Tearfully) Ross, I\\'m doing everything that I can, I\\'ve got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it\\nAnimal Control\\nSee? I\\'ve even called Animal Control\\nYou called Animal Control\\nUh-huh... why... do you not like them\\nMarcel is an illegal exotic animal. I\\'m not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they\\'ll take him away from me\\nO-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..\\nThat\\'s right, I.. \\'cause I didn\\'t expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment\\nHi, thanks for coming\\n(Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey\\nOh, y\\'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding\\nYeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn\\'t\\nTurned out it was a hat\\nCat\\nCat! What\\'m I saying? Cat\\nHi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one\\'s seen Marcel\\nMarcel\\nMy uncle Marcel\\nOh, is that who the monkey\\'s named after\\nOookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal\\nOh my God. You\\'d put that poor little creature in jail\\nPheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first\\nYes, but there isn\\'t always time\\nLook. I\\'m sure there\\'s some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven\\'t been introduced, I\\'m Monica Geller\\nOh my God, you are! And you\\'re Rachel Green\\nYeah\\nLuisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room\\nLuisa? Oh my God! Monica! It\\'s Luisa\\nThe Luisa from home room\\nYes!\\nYou have no idea who I am, do you\\nNo, none at all\\nNone\\nWell, maybe that\\'s because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say \\'Morning, Luisa\\'? Or \\'Nice overalls\\'\\nOh, I\\'m- I\\'m so sorry\\nAh, it\\'s not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch\\nWhat?\\nBe that as it may, d\\'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y\\'know, just for old times\\' sake? Go Bobcats\\nI could... but I won\\'t. If I find that monkey, he\\'s mine\\nDun-dun-duuuur! Sorry\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nHi, can I help you\\nUm, we\\'re kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..\\nA monkey\\nYes have you seen any\\nNo. No, haven\\'t seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators\\nUm, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way\\nOf course\\nOh. Then, no\\nDid I put too much rum in here\\nJust a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey\\nOh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu\\nUh, aren\\'t we kind of in the middle of something here\\nYes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they\\'re very hot\\nWe can\\'t, alright? (To the women) We\\'re sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we\\'d find this monkey. If you see him, he\\'s about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you\\'d really be helping us out\\nOkay, from now on, you don\\'t get to talk to other people\\nMarcel\\nMarcel?\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nOh-my-God\\nWhaaat\\nSomething just brushed up against my right leg\\nWhat is it\\nOh, it\\'s okay, it was just my left leg\\nLook, Phoebe\\nYeah! Oh, c\\'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c\\'mere\\nStep aside, ladies\\nWhat\\'re you gonna do\\nJust a small tranquiliser\\nRun, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay\\nYeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah\\nOh gosh\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarc- oh, this is ridiculous! We\\'ve been all over the neighbourhood. He\\'s gone, he\\'s-he\\'s just gone\\nRoss, you don\\'t know that\\nOh come on. It\\'s cold, it\\'s dark, he doesn\\'t know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much\\nRoss, I said I\\'m sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I\\'m gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?\\nYeah, yeah. Y\\'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don\\'t miss Marcel any more\\nY\\'know, it is not like I did this on purpose\\nOh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you\\'re off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people\\'s monkeys, or to people\\'s feelings..\\nRoss\\nI don\\'t even wanna hear it, you\\'re just..\\nRoss\\nOh, forget it, okay\\nRoss\\nWhat? What\\nHey! Hey, Bananaman\\nEveryone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles\\' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas\\nOh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea\\nHi, did you order some bananas\\nWhat about it\\nGimme back my monkey\\nI don\\'t have a monkey\\nThen what\\'s with all the bananas\\nPotassium\\nMarcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel\\nMarcel! What\\'ve you done to him\\nThat\\'s my monkey. That\\'s Patti, Patti the monkey\\nAre you insane? C\\'mere, Marcel, c\\'mon\\nC\\'mere, Patti\\nC\\'mere, Marcel\\nC\\'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr\\n(Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa\\'s cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha\\nOkay, gimme my monkey back\\nThat\\'s my monkey\\nYou\\'re both gonna have to take this up with the judge\\nThat\\'s not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever\\nAlright, I want my monkey\\nNo\\nOh, c\\'mon, Luisa\\nSorry, prom queen\\n(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn\\'t\\'ve been fat\\nAlright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C\\'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it\\nNope\\nAlright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress off Marcel\\nIt\\'ll be nice to get this off finally, won\\'t it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that\\'s fine\\nY\\'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit\\nListen, I\\'m- I\\'m sorry I was so hard on you before, it\\'s just I..\\nOh, Ross, c\\'mon. It\\'s my fault, I almost lost your..\\nYeah, but you were the one who got him back, y\\'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape\\nThat\\'d be good\\nAlright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we\\'re here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..\\nRachel\\nBarry?\\nI can\\'t. I can\\'t do it, I can\\'t marry Mindy. I think I\\'m still in love with you\\nOh\\nWe have got to start locking that door\\nThis is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids\\nNope\\nThat\\'s because I\\'m in front of them\\nEh. I thought that was an alp\\nWell, high school was not my favourite time\\nI dunno, I loved high school. Y\\'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex\\nYeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice\\nGosh, doesn\\'t it seem like a million years ago\\nOh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there\\nI can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty\\nNo way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he\\'s got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is\\nI don\\'t know, you don\\'t wanna mess with corn nuts. They\\'re craaazy\\n(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There\\'s some creep out there with a telescope\\nI can\\'t believe it! He\\'s looking right at us\\nOh, that is so sick\\nI feel violated. And not in a good way\\nHow can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots\\nCentral Perk, everyone but Rachel is there\\nI am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games..\\nSo have you called her yet\\nLet her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It\\'s the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I\\'m right, right\\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle\\nI can\\'t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people\\nOh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney\\nWhich, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine\\nHer answer machine\\nNo, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up\\nSo, uh, why didn\\'t you say anything\\nOh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o\\nLook look! It\\'s Rachel and Barry. No, don\\'t everybody look at once\\nOkay, okay, what\\'s going on\\nOkay, they\\'re just talking..\\nYeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything\\nNo, no actually, he\\'s smiling.. and... Oh my God, don\\'t do that!\\nWhat? What? What?\\nThat man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh\\n(bluffing) And basically, that\\'s how a bill becomes a law\\nOh!... Right\\nHey Rach\\nHow\\'d it go\\nY\\'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y\\'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..\\nNot a good day for birds..\\nThen we took a walk down to Bendall\\'s, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..\\nThat\\'s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm\\nRight,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y\\'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice\\nThat\\'s, that\\'s nice twice\\nRachel, what\\'s going on? I mean isn\\'t this the same Barry who you left at the altar\\nDuh, where\\'ve you been\\nYeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn\\'t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y\\'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that\\nYes\\nWhy\\nI have my reasons\\nOkay, how about the fact that he\\'s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend\\nAll right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it\\'s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it\\nBarry\\'s Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair\\nWow... Wow\\nYeah\\nI\\'m not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that\\nNooo, it wasn\\'t\\nOoh, and it\\'s so nice having this little sink here..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there except Rachel\\n(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn\\'t expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God\\nThat\\'s what you\\'ve been working on for the past two hours?\\nHey, I\\'ve been honing\\nWhat was with the dishes\\nOh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y\\'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven\\'t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours\\n(looking out the window) Look look! He\\'s doing it again, the guy with the telescope\\nOh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here\\nGreat, now he\\'s waving back\\nMan, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can\\'t do stuff\\nWhat kinda stuff\\nWill you grow up? I\\'m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I\\'m cooking naked\\nYou cook naked\\nYeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters\\nWhat are you looking at me for? I didn\\'t know that\\nBarry\\'s Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed\\nWhat\\'s the matter\\nOh, it\\'s just... Oh, Barry, this was not good\\nNo, it was. It was very very good\\nWell, what about Mindy\\nOh, way, way better than Mindy\\nNo, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy\\nWell, if you want, I\\'ll justÑI\\'ll just break it off with her\\nNo. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don\\'t do that. Not, I mean not for me\\n(over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment\\n(into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let\\'s go away this weekend\\nOh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.\\nWe can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would\\'ve liked it\\nI had a bra\\nHey, Dr. Farber\\nAll right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we\\'re starting to see some real progress here\\nWhat?\\nI\\'m twelve, I\\'m not stupid\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler enters clutching his phone\\nCan I use your phone\\nYeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone\\nYes, it\\'s working! Why isn\\'t she calling me back\\nMaybe she never got your message\\nY\\'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn\\'t get her messages yet\\nY\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little..\\n...desperate, needy, pathetic\\nAh, you obviously saw my personal ad\\nHow many beeps\\nShe answered\\nY\\'see, this is where you\\'d use that \\'hello\\' word we talked about\\nI\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I\\'m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy\\nHey! Hi\\nHow\\'d he take it\\nPretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen\\n(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair\\nOh, do I\\nUh huh\\n(in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair\\nYou had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn\\'t I\\nYou-you had what\\nSex in his chair\\nWhat, uh... what were you thinking\\nI don\\'t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There\\'s a history there. \\'S\\'like you and Carol\\nNo! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol\\nPlease. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,\" what would you say\\nIf it helps, I could slide over\\nIt\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It\\'s, it\\'s apples and oranges, it\\'s, it\\'s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go\\nWhere are you going\\n(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay\\nHello? Hello\\n(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I\\'ve heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I\\'m working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I\\'ll, so I\\'ll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God\\nSo how\\'s Mindy\\nOh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it\\'s me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that\\'s where you\\'d be\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the next morning.Ê Chandler is sitting and staring at his phone.Ê Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler\\nBrrrrrrr\\nHell is filled with people like you\\n(entering) He\\'s back! The peeper\\'s back\\n(ducking) Get down\\nGet down\\n...And boogie\\nThanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy\\nRelax. Y\\'know, she may not even know\\nPlease. I haven\\'t heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.\\n(intrigued) Yeah\\nAnd now, y\\'know, I\\'m like... I\\'m like the other woman! I feel so.\\n..Naughty\\nRight, I\\'ll see you guys later..\\nOh, hold up, I\\'ll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That\\'s fine, yeah..\\nOkay, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone\\nWhy don\\'t you just take it with you\\nHey, we haven\\'t been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee\\nWhy don\\'t you just call her\\nI can\\'t call her, I left a message! I have some pride\\nDo you\\nNo! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Chandler! (Listens) I\\'m fine. Uh, listen, I don\\'t know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that\\'s fine, that\\'s great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She\\'s on the other line, she\\'s gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.)

So, what\\'s up\\nUm.. we should really be sitting for this\\nSure we should... So\\nNow, I know things\\'ve been weird lately, but you\\'re like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don\\'t talk to anywhere, \\'cause she\\'s all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn\\'t have a pretty face. ....Okay, I\\'m just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer\\nOkay\\nWill you be my maid of honour\\nOf course\\nOh that\\'s so great\\nWas that all you wanted to ask me\\nThat\\'s all\\nOhhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What\\nThat\\'s not all\\nOh sure it is\\nOh no, it isn\\'t! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city\\nUm, what- what would make you think that\\nWell, ever since we announced the engagement, he\\'s been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel\\n(draws back) Really. Mindy, if it\\'ll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too\\nOh God! You see, that\\'s what I was afraid of\\nWhat? What\\'s what you were afraid of\\nOkay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side\\nWhat\\nI know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said \"Don\\'t do it, he\\'s just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,\" and now I feel so stupid\\nUh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid\\nWhat do you mean\\n(offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar\\nOh no\\nOh, I am so sorry\\nNo me, I am so sorry..\\n(watches them for a while) Oh my\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking, and Chandler is still staring at his phone\\nFour letters: \"Circle or hoop\"\\nRing dammit, ring\\nThanks\\n(entering) Hey, you know our phone\\'s not working\\nWhat?\\nI tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer\\n(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off\\nJust like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony\\nHey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper\\'s name! Can I use the phone\\nNngghhh!!!!!!\\n(to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please\\n\"Heating device\\nRadiator\\nFive letters\\nRdtor\\n(on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney\\'s a woman\\nSo she\\'s a woman! So what\\nYeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don\\'t appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn\\'t have to feel likeÑ(Listens)ÑThank you, but... that\\'s not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.\\nJoey!\\n(on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress\\nThe green dress? Really\\nYeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day\\n(waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo\\nBarry\\'s Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters\\nHey. Got a second\\nSure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in..\\nHello, sweetheart\\nUh... uh... what\\'re\\'you... what\\'re\\'you guys doing here\\nUh, we are here to break up with you\\nBoth of you\\nBasically, we think you\\'re a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you\\nI\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry, God, I am so sorry, I\\'m an idiot, I was weak, I couldn\\'t help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much\\nUh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr\\n....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy\\nEven when we were having sex in that chair\\n(to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you\\nPlease! During that second time you couldn\\'t have picked her out of a lineup\\n(to Rachel) You did it twice\\nWell, the first time didn\\'t really count... I mean, y\\'know, \\'s\\'Barry\\nOkay..\\n(to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we\\'ll start all over again. We\\'ll go back to Aruba\\n(over intercom) Dr. Farber, we\\'ve got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer\\nOh God... (Into intercom) I\\'ll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don\\'t go anywhere, okay? I\\'ll be, I\\'ll be right back\\nOkay. Okay, we\\'ll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I\\'m hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I\\'m telling you, this feels great\\nYeah... I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m still gonna marry him\\nWhat are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He\\'s Satan in a smock\\nLook, I know he\\'s not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S\\nOh God\\nI hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you\\'ll still be my maid of honor...\\nAnd I hope Barry doesn\\'t kill you and eat you in Aruba\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Rachel are there\\nYou okay\\nYeah\\nReally\\nYeah! Y\\'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know\\nAww..\\nBig day\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there\\nAll right, I\\'ll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he\\'s got the monocle, he\\'s got the top hat..\\nYou know he\\'s gay\\nI just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut\\n(entering) Chandler\\nDanielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody\\nHi. Hi\\nWhat are you doing here\\nWell, I\\'ve been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I\\'d just come down here, and make sure you were okay\\n...I\\'m, I\\'m okay\\nListen uh, maybe we could get together later\\nThat sounds good. I\\'ll call you- or you call me, whatever..\\nYou got it\\nOkay\\nG\\'bye, everybody\\nBye\\nWhoo-hoo\\nYeah, there you go\\nSecond date\\n...I dunno\\nYou don\\'t know?\\nWell, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is looking at papers\\nHow could someone get a hold of your credit card number\\nI have no idea. But look how much they spent\\nMonica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought\\nI know. It\\'s just such reckless spending\\nI think when someone steals your credit card, they\\'ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind\\nWow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop\\nThat\\'s me\\nOh! The yuk! Ross, he\\'s doing it again\\nMarcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping\\nOh no, not in my room! I\\'ll get him\\nRoss, you\\'ve got to do something about the humping\\nWhat? It\\'s, it\\'s just a phase\\nWell, that\\'s what we said about Joey..\\nWould you all relax? It\\'s not that big a deal\\n(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey\\nWhat\\nLet\\'s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room\\nOh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing\\nThis woman\\'s living my life\\nWhat\\nShe\\'s living my life, and she\\'s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I\\'m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies\\nYou\\'re not an artist\\nYeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don\\'t\\nOh, Monica, c\\'mon, you do cool things\\nOh really? Okay, let\\'s compare, shall we\\n(Yawning) Oh, it\\'s so late for \\'Shall we\\'..\\nDo I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School\\n(Yawning) Nooo..\\nThis is so unfair! She\\'s got everything I want, and she doesn\\'t have my mother\\nCentral Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names\\nHow about Joey... Pepponi\\nNo, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that\\'s more neutral\\nJoey... Switzerland\\nPlus, y\\'know, I think it should be Joe. Y\\'know, Joey makes me sound like I\\'m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I\\'m not\\nJoe...Joe...Joe...Stalin\\nStalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar\\nWell, it does not ring a bell with me..\\n(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y\\'know, that\\'s pretty good\\nMight wanna try Joseph\\nJoseph Stalin. I think you\\'d remember that\\nOh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter\\nHey\\nHey\\nHi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I\\'m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were\\nWhat are you doing\\n(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I\\'m going to tap class\\nWhat, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card\\nThis woman\\'s got my life, I should get to see who she is\\nGo to the post office! I\\'m sure her picture\\'s up! ...Okay, Monica, y\\'know what, honey, you\\'re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing\\nThis is madness. It\\'s madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don\\'t do it!! ...Thank you\\nA Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door\\nWhat d\\'you think\\nLotsa things\\nWhich one do you think she is\\nMay I help you\\nOh, no thanks, we\\'re just here to observe\\nYou don\\'t observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there\\nWhat does she mean\\nI think she means (Imitates) \\'You dance a dance class\\'. Oh, c\\'mon, c\\'mon\\nOkay, d\\'y\\'see anybody you think could be me\\n(To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let\\'s not have that happen again\\nShe could be you\\nLet\\'s get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..\\nOkay, I\\'m not getting this\\n(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I\\'m totally getting it\\nDid you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated\\nWhat? You just click when they click\\nAlright people, now everyone grab a partner\\nOkay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I\\'m with Rachel\\nGreat. It\\'s gym class all over again\\nAww\\nWell that\\'s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me\\nWhy don\\'t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare\\nIt\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, I\\'m here, I\\'m here. Sorry I\\'m late, okay, here I am. Who\\'s the new tense girl\\nShe\\'s your partner\\nHi. I\\'m Monica\\nOh. Monica! ...Hi. I\\'m Mo- ...nana\\n(Fake Monica) Monana\\nYeah. It\\'s Dutch\\nYou\\'re kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam\\nUm, Pennsylvania Dutch\\nAnd we\\'re dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..\\nCentral Perk, Ross is entering\\n(Mortified) Hi\\nHey\\nWhere\\'ve you been\\nAt the vet\\nShe\\'s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she\\nShe says Marcel\\'s humping thing\\'s not a phase. Apparently he\\'s reached sexual maturity\\n(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya\\nShe says as time goes on, he\\'s gonna start getting agressive and violent\\nSo what does this mean\\nI\\'m gonna have to give him up\\nCentral Perk, scene continued from earlier.Ê They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys\\nI can\\'t believe it, Ross. This sucks\\nI don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already\\nI know. I know. I mean, one day, he\\'s this little thing, and before you know it, he\\'s this little thing I can\\'t get off my leg\\nIsn\\'t there any way you can keep him\\nNo, no. The vet says unless he\\'s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,\\' he\\'s just gonna get vicious. I\\'ve just gotta get him into a zoo\\nHow do you get a monkey into a zoo\\nI know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen\\nWell, we\\'re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y\\'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y\\'know, he\\'s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that\\'s a possibility\\nYeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo\\nHey. We found her, we found the girl\\nWhat\\nDid you call the cops\\nNope. We took her to lunch\\nAh. Your own brand of vigilante justice\\nWhat?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She\\'s a stealer\\nY\\'know what? After you\\'re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit\\nYeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader\\n...Take off their hats\\nPopes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there\\nNo way. No way did you do this\\nMonana was very brave\\nIt was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor\\nSo once they caught on to the fact that we\\'re, y\\'know, short and have breasts..\\n...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me\\nGo Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don\\'t know. Don\\'t wait up\\nOh, by the way, tomorrow we\\'re auditioning for a Broadway show\\n\\'Scuse me\\nThere\\'s an open call for Cats. I\\'m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say\\nNononononono. Think who you\\'re dealing with here. I mean, I\\'m not like you. I-I can\\'t even stand in front of a tap class\\nWell, that\\'s just probably \\'cause of your Amish background\\nWhat\\nWell, you\\'re Pennsylvania Dutch, right\\nRight. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned\\nI-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets\\' Society\\nUh-huh\\nI thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can\\'t be in the play? What was that?! It\\'s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, \\'Now, that\\'s two hours of my life that I\\'m never getting back.\\' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do\\nWow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, tiem lapse.Ê Everyone but Joey and Monica are there\\n(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn\\'t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don\\'t know who this is harder on, me or him\\nI\\'d say that chair\\'s taking the brunt\\nMarcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him\\nOh, somebody will\\n(entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin\\nYou\\'re kidding\\nApparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You\\'d think you would\\'ve known that\\nY\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve\\nPhoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be\\n...Flame Boy\\nCentral Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper\\nWhere exactly is your zoo\\nWell, it\\'s technically not a zoo per se, it\\'s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel\\nYes\\nDoes he, uh, fight with other animals\\nNo-no, he\\'s, he\\'s very docile\\nEven if he were... cornered\\nWell I, I don\\'t know. Why\\nUh, how is he at handling small objects\\nHe can hold a banana, if that\\'s whatcha mean..\\nHow about a hammer, or a small blade\\nWhy- why- why would he need a blade\\nWell, if he\\'s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you\\'ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it\\'s just cruel\\nHe- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego\\nWe, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..\\n...He\\'s in\\nHe\\'s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego\\nYou\\'re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego\\'s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I\\'ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk\\nYo- hooo\\nWhere the hell\\'ve you been\\nMonica and I just crashed an embassy party\\nAre you drunk?\\nNoooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I\\'m lying. I am so drunk\\nOh God, oh. Great, Monica, y\\'know what, you could\\'ve called, I have been up here, I\\'ve been worried..\\nMonica? Monica\\nWater rules\\nYes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you\\'re gonna be showing up for work\\nNope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today\\nOkay Monica, what are you doing? You\\'re gonna lose your job! This is not you\\nNo, it is me! Y\\'know, I\\'m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y\\'know, when I\\'m with her, I am so much more than that. I\\'m- I\\'m Monana\\nHello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it\\'s for you, the credit card people\\nHelloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks\\nWhat\\nThey\\'ve arrested Monica\\nNew York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica\\nHi\\nHey\\nHow are you\\nI\\'m not too bad. Fortunately, blue\\'s my colour. How-how did you know I was here\\nBecause... I\\'m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using\\nThat I was not expecting\\nI want you to know, it wasn\\'t me who turned you in\\nOh. Thanks\\nNo, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn\\'t for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater\\nWell, actually, you only got to sing \\'Memo-\\'\\nI just can\\'t believe you\\'re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who\\'s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who\\'s gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus\\nMonica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you\\'re worried about who\\'s gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus\\nWell, not... worried, just... wondering\\nThere\\'s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You\\'re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that\\'s who you are\\nNot necessarily..\\nYes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it\\'s the Amish thing\\nUm, I\\'m not actually Amish\\nReally? Then why are you like that\\nTap Class, Monica is standing by the door\\nYou by the door. In or out\\nIn. (She joins in the dancing\\nYou in the back, you\\'re getting it all wrong\\nYeah, but at least I\\'m doing it\\nThe Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel\\nThis is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A\\nOkay.

Now, I know there\\'s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there\\'s also a lot to learn\\nI dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it\\'s a monkey\\nJust, just say what you feel\\nMarcel, I\\'m hungry\\nThat was good\\n(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It\\'s, uh, just, y\\'know, something to, um, do on the plane\\nUh, if you guys don\\'t mind, I\\'d like to take a moment, just me and him\\nOh, sure. Sure, absolutely\\nMarcel, c\\'mere, c\\'mere.

You\\'ve been more than just a pet to me, you\\'ve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him\\nA Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play\\n(Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek..\\nThat\\'s fine, thank you\\nNext\\nHi, uh, I\\'ll be reading for the role of Mercutio\\nName\\nHolden McGroin\\nCentral Perk.

Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..\\nDoing it on this table\\nWow\\nExellent dream score\\nWhy, why, why would you dream that\\nMore importantly, was I any good\\nWell, you were pretty damn good\\nInteresting, cause in my dreams, I\\'m allways surprisingly inadequate\\nWell, last night you seemed to know your way around the table\\nI love it, when we share\\nYou\\'re okay there\\nI can\\'t belive you two had sex in her dream\\nI\\'m sorry, it was a one-time-thing.

It\\'s a whole big boob story\\nI could be a secretary\\nWell, you know Phoebs. I don\\'t know if it\\'s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal.

Look at him\\nBen, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don\\'t think that\\'s his name\\nOh, look, look, he\\'s closing his eyes.

Pffffffft\\nHey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I\\'ll pay you back\\nOh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars\\nI will, really. I\\'ll pay you back this time\\n(sigh)... And where\\'s this money coming from\\nWell... I\\'m helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research\\n(overhearing) What kind of research\\nOh, just, y\\'know.... science\\nScience. Yeah, I think I\\'ve heard of that\\n(sigh)... It\\'s a fertility study\\nOh, Joey, please tell me you\\'re only donating your time\\nAlright, come on you guys, it\\'s not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars\\nHey\\nWow, ooh, you\\'re gonna be making money hand over fist\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Phoebe are preparing for a barbecue for Rachel\\'s birthday\\nOK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..\\nWe\\'ve got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew..\\n(in a deep voice) Men are here\\nWe make fire.

What does she think of your little science project\\nWhat, you think I\\'m gonna tell a girl I like that I\\'m also seeing a cup\\nMan\\'s got a point\\nWell, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me\\nCrazy bitch\\nYeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I\\'m not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean\\nJoey... we always know what you mean\\nHey\\nHey\\nHey\\nHow long did you think this barbecue was gonna last\\nI\\'m going to China\\nJeez, you say one thing, and..\\nYou\\'re going to China\\nYeah, i-it\\'s for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don\\'t want us to have the bone, so I\\'m going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boÑit\\'sÑit\\'s a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I\\'m gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can\\'t. So here\\'s my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here\\'s a picture of me..\\nOh, let me see\\n(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol\\'s every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn\\'t forget me\\nYeah\\nHi, Ben. I\\'m your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun\\nHey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left\\nOh no, she\\'s out having drinks with Carl\\nOh. (pause) Hey, who\\'s Carl\\nYou know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse\\nNo\\nOh, well, see, there\\'s this guy she met at the..\\nAt the coffeehouse, right\\nSo you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry\\nOK, I\\'m gonna go say goodbye to the guys\\nOh, hey, y\\'know what? Tell them that bone story\\nHi\\nHey\\nHey\\n(sigh)....I have to go to China\\nThe country\\nNo no, this big pile of dishes in my mom\\'s breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is\\nUh, let\\'s see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no\\nWell, Rachel\\'s having drinks with him tonight\\nOh no! How can she do that when she\\'s never shown any interest in you?!\\nForget about her\\nHe\\'s right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food\\nCourse there, they just call it food\\nYeah... I guess. I don\\'tÑI don\\'t know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK\\nListen, buddy, we\\'re just looking out for you\\nI know\\nWe want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man\\nI\\'m still on my first. I just think you\\'re nice\\nAnyway, that\\'s when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves \\'The Three Basketeers\\nLike the three musketeers, only with fruit\\n(sarcastic) Ooooh\\n(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers\\nOh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later\\nHey, hold on there, tiger. How\\'s it going? How you holding up\\nWell, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we\\'re gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..\\nThen you do. Heh, heh\\nSo, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her\\nWhat do you mean\\nY\\'know, just be there for her\\nNot following you\\nThink about it\\nOK, I\\'m guessing this is from..\\nWell, thank you, Melanie\\n(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me\\n(picks it up) OK... ah, it\\'s light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it\\'s... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you\\nThis one\\'s from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it\\'s a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it\\'s a book\\nOh, it\\'s Dr. Seuss\\n(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times\\nThere is a little child inside this man\\nYes, the doctors say if they remove it, he\\'ll die\\nWho\\'s this from\\nOh, that\\'s Ross\\'s\\nOh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered\\nRemembered what\\nIt was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can\\'t believe he remembered\\nWell, sure, but can you play it on a plane\\nOh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune\\nI can\\'t believe he did this\\nCome on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck\\nWhat did you just say\\n(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck\\nNo, no, no.... the, um, the... \\'love\\' part\\n(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin...\\nOh.... my God\\n(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...\\n(pats Chandler on the leg) That\\'s good, just keep rubbing your head. That\\'ll turn back time\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, continued from earlier\\nI mean, this is unbelievable\\nI know. This is really, really huge\\nNo it\\'s not. It\\'s small. It\\'s tiny. It\\'s petite. It\\'s wee\\nNuh-uh. I don\\'t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again\\nOK, is there a mute button on this woman\\nI think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea\\nNo! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me\\nWell, given that he\\'s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn\\'t mind getting a cup of coffee or something\\nRoss? All this time? Well, I\\'ve got to talk to him\\n(quickly) H-He\\'s in China\\nThe country\\nNo, no, wait. (checks Ross\\'s itinerary) His flight doesn\\'t leave for another forty-five more minutes\\nWhat about the time difference\\nFrom here to the airport\\nYes! (Rachel walks towards door) You\\'re never gonna make it\\nRachel, what\\'re you gonna say to him\\nI-I-I don\\'t know\\nWell then maybe you shouldn\\'t go\\nHe\\'s right, cause if you\\'re just gonna, like, break his heart, that\\'s the kind of thing that can wait\\nYeah, but if it\\'s good news, you should tell him now\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'ll know when I see him\\nHere, look, alright, does this help\\nNoooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y\\'know, I just, I\\'ve just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I\\'ll see you later\\nRachel, I love you! Deal with me first\\nAirport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a \\'How To Speak Chinese\\' tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there\\nAlright\\nNi-chou chi-ma\\nRoss! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...\\nHi\\nHi\\nMay I see your boarding pass\\nOh, no, no, I don\\'t have one. I just need to talk to my friend\\nOh, oooh. I\\'m sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass\\nNo, I know, but IÑhe just went on. He\\'s right there, he\\'s got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..\\nNo no no! Federal regulations\\nOK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important\\nAlright. What\\'s the message\\nUh... I don\\'t know\\nSir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you\\n(confused) What\\nIt\\'s from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back\\n(to wife): Toby... Oh, for God\\'s sake, I don\\'t know what she\\'s talking about! There\\'s no Rachel! Don\\'t give me that deep freeze\\nJoey\\'s Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together\\nMmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute\\nHeh, heh. It was nothin\\'\\nWell, now we\\'ve gotta find something fun for you\\n(panicked) Uhhh.. y\\'know what? Forget about me. Let\\'s, uh... let\\'s give you another turn\\n(surprised) M-Me again\\nSure! Why not\\nBoy, somebody\\'s gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow\\nOooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be\\nHow do you mean\\nI don\\'t know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who\\'re always \\'me, me, me.\\' But you... you\\'re a giver. You\\'re like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you\\'re practically a woman\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding the wrapping paper from one of Rachel\\'s gifts\\nUh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it\\'s only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y\\'know, it\\'s Ross. Y\\'know what I mean? I mean, it\\'s Ross\\nSure\\nI don\\'t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I\\'m thinking... oh, I\\'m thinking it\\'d be really great\\nOh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we\\'d be like friends-in-law! Y\\'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it\\'s like starting on the fifteenth date\\nYeah, but, y\\'know, it\\'s... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date\\nAnother good point\\nNo, I mean, I mean, when you\\'re at the fifteenth date, y\\'know, you\\'re already in a very relationshippy place. Y\\'know, it\\'s... you\\'re committed\\n(confused) Huh\\nWell, I mean, then what happens if it doesn\\'t work out\\nWhy isn\\'t it working out\\nI don\\'t know... sometimes it doesn\\'t\\nIs he not cute enough for you\\nNo\\nDoes he not make enough money\\nNo, I\\'m just...\\nMaybe there\\'s someone else\\nWha..\\nIs there? Is there someone else\\nNo! There is.. there is noone else\\nThen why the hell are you dumping my brother?!\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door\\nHey, big..\\nShhhh\\n(quietly) ...spender\\nShe\\'s still asleep\\nSo how\\'d it go\\nOh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you\\'re great in bed\\nThe fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me\\nWell, it\\'s like, last night, I couldn\\'t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade\\nYes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route\\nIt was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, I\\'m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y\\'know? It\\'s like... I was able to appreciate it on another level\\nI didn\\'t know you had another level\\nI know! Neither did I\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom\\nHey, great skirt! Birthday present\\nYeah\\nOh, from who\\nFrom you. I exchanged the blouse you got me\\nWell, it\\'s the thought. Hey, doesn\\'t Ross\\'s flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B\\nUh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y\\'know, honey, I\\'ve been thinking about it and I\\'ve decided thisÑthis whole Ross thing, it\\'s just not a good idea\\nOh, why\\nBecause, I feel like I wouldn\\'t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don\\'t wanna..\\n(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure\\nMonica, nothing has even happened yet, and you\\'re already so..\\nI am not \\'so\\'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I\\'ll be good. I promise\\nWho is it\\nIt\\'s me, Carl\\nC\\'mon up\\nBehind my brother\\'s back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won\\'t be hearing from me\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand\\nSeven hundred bucks\\nAlright, you did it! Do we have any fruit\\nMan, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y\\'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something\\nReally? So, you\\'re gonna stick with this \\'it\\'s all for her\\' thing\\nWhat, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl\\nI\\'m just sayin\\', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I\\'m gonna shoot myself! I mean, don\\'t get me wrong... I\\'m not against environmental issues per se.... it\\'s just that guy\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'d rather go out with him than me\\nWould you excuse me, please? I\\'m trying to have a date here\\nFine, just stop thinking about me\\nCan\\'t do it, can you\\nSo I\\'m thinking about you. So what\\nI don\\'t get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway\\nWell... he happens to be a very nice... guy...\\nI mean, come on, buddy, get a real car\\nRachel, come on. Give us a chance\\nRoss, it\\'s too hard\\nNo, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I\\'ve been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade\\nRoss, you\\'re like my best friend\\nI know\\nIf we broke up, and I lost you..\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we\\'re gonna break up\\nWell, have you been involved with someone where you haven\\'t broken up\\n(pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me\\nI don\\'t know... I mean, I\\'ve never looked at you that way before\\nWell, start looking\\nWow\\nExactly! And you just know I\\'m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic\\nRight! You\\'re right\\nHeh... y\\'know\\nYou know what\\nWhat\\nI forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I\\'m so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I meanÑI\\'m sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I\\'m sorry\\nBut..\\nAirport. Madonna\\'s Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at the gate with flowers\\n(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi\\nFor God\\'s sake, will you let it go? There\\'s no Rachel\\nOh, hey, hey, I got that\\nOh, thanks, sweetie\\nNo problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends\\nReally\\nYeah\\nYou don\\'t think they\\'ll judge and ridicule me\\nNo, no, they will. I just... uh..\\nCan\\'t wait\\nCome on, they\\'re gonna love you'"
